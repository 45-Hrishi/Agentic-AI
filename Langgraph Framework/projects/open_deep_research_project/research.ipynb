These agents leverage LLMs to perform a wide range of tasks, from generating sales leads to making investment decisions. However, the choice of framework for building these agents can significantly affect their efficiency and effectiveness. In this blog, we will evaluate three prominent frameworks for building AI agents — LangGraph, Autogen, and Crew AI — to help you make an informed choice.\\nBy the way, we are constantly sharing our insights on agents. Don\\'t miss out on other pieces in the Mastering Agents series.\\n\\nTypes of agents\\nLangGraph Vs Autogen Vs Crew AI\\nHow to evaluate agents\\nLearn to fix agents\\nTop agent benchmarks\\nMetrics for chatbot agents\\n\\nWhat is an Agent?\\nAn agent in AI is a software application that uses LLMs to perform specific tasks autonomously. These tasks can range from answering research questions to invoking backend services. Agents can be particularly useful in scenarios requiring open-ended answers, where they can provide surprisingly effective solutions.\\nCustomer support agents are capable of addressing customer inquiries, supplying information, and autonomously resolving issues. While code generation agents can generate, debug, and run code snippets, assisting developers in automating repetitive tasks.\\n\\n\\nAutoDev: Automated AI-Driven Development\\nWhen to Use Agents\\nAgents are highly beneficial when tasks require complex decision-making, autonomy, and adaptability. They excel in environments where the workflow is dynamic and involves multiple steps or interactions that can benefit from automation. For instance, in customer support, agents can handle a wide range of queries, provide real-time assistance, and escalate issues to human operators when necessary. This not only improves efficiency but also enhances the customer experience by providing timely and accurate responses.\\nIn research and data analysis, agents can autonomously gather, process, and analyze large volumes of data, providing valuable insights without human intervention. They are also useful in scenarios requiring real-time data processing, such as financial trading, where agents can make split-second decisions based on market conditions.\\nMoreover, agents are beneficial in educational applications, where they can provide personalized learning experiences, adapt to the student\\'s pace, and offer instant feedback. In software development, agents can assist in code generation, debugging, and testing, significantly reducing development time and improving code quality. The ability of agents to learn from interactions and improve over time makes them invaluable in environments where continuous improvement and adaptation are crucial.\\nWhen Not to Use Agents\\nAgents offer numerous advantages but there are scenarios where their use may not be the right choice.\\nTo be clear, in scenarios where tasks are straightforward, infrequent, or require minimal automation, the complexity of implementing agents may not be justified. Simple tasks that existing software solutions can easily manage do not necessarily benefit from the added complexity of agent-based systems. In such cases, traditional methods are more efficient and cost-effective.\\nAdditionally, tasks that require deep domain-specific knowledge and expertise, which cannot be easily encoded into an agent, may not benefit from automation. For instance, complex legal analysis, intricate medical diagnoses, or high-stakes decision-making in uncertain environments often require the expertise and intuition of seasoned professionals. In such cases, relying solely on agents can lead to suboptimal or even harmful outcomes.\\nAgents are also not well-suited for tasks that require a high level of human empathy, creativity, or subjective judgment. For example, in fields such as psychotherapy, counseling, or creative writing, the nuances of human emotions and creativity are difficult for agents to replicate. In these cases, human interaction is irreplaceable and essential for achieving the desired outcomes.\\nImplementing agents requires a significant investment in terms of time, resources, and expertise. For small businesses or projects with limited budgets, the cost of developing and maintaining agents may outweigh the benefits. Furthermore, in highly regulated industries, the use of agents may be restricted due to compliance and security concerns. Ensuring that agents adhere to stringent regulatory requirements can be challenging and resource-intensive.\\nLangGraph vs Autogen vs Crew AI\\nHaving clarified when to utilize an agent, let’s shift our focus to the primary topic: the most widely adopted frameworks in the industry. We conducted a poll and identified three frameworks that are most commonly used. Let’s begin with a high-level overview of these frameworks.\\n\\n\\nLangGraph\\nLangGraph is an open-source framework designed by Langchain to build stateful, multi-actor applications using LLMs. Inspired by the long history of representing data processing pipelines as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), LangGraph treats workflows as graphs where each node represents a specific task or function. This graph-based approach allows for fine-grained control over the flow and state of applications, making it particularly suitable for complex workflows that require advanced memory features, error recovery, and human-in-the-loop interactions. LangGraph integrates seamlessly with LangChain, providing access to a wide range of tools and models, and supports various multi-agent interaction patterns.\\nAutogen\\nAutogen is a versatile framework developed by Microsoft for building conversational agents. It treats workflows as conversations between agents, making it intuitive for users who prefer interactive ChatGPT-like interfaces. Autogen supports various tools, including code executors and function callers, allowing agents to perform complex tasks autonomously. The framework is highly customizable, enabling users to extend agents with additional components and define custom workflows. Autogen is designed to be modular and easy to maintain, making it suitable for both simple and complex multi-agent scenarios.\\nCrew AI\\nCrew AI is a framework designed to facilitate the collaboration of role-based AI agents. Each agent in Crew AI is assigned specific roles and goals, allowing them to operate as a cohesive unit. This framework is ideal for building sophisticated multi-agent systems such as multi-agent research teams. Crew AI supports flexible task management, autonomous inter-agent delegation, and customizable tools.\\nLet\\'s compare LangGraph, Autogen, and Crew AI across several key aspects for practical consideration.\\nEase of Usage\\nEase of usage determines how quickly and efficiently a developer can get started with a framework. It affects the learning curve and the time required to build and deploy agents.\\nLangGraph: LangGraph treats workflows as graphs, which can be intuitive for those familiar with data processing pipelines. It uses directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to represent workflows, making it easier to visualize and manage complex processes. However, it may require a deeper understanding of graph-based structures.\\nAutogen: Autogen treats workflows as conversations between agents. This conversational approach can be more intuitive for users who prefer chat interfaces. The framework handles the heavy lifting of managing agent interactions, making it easier to get started. It abstracts much of the complexity, allowing users to focus on defining tasks and interactions.\\nCrew AI: Crew AI focuses on role-based agent design, where each agent has specific roles and goals.

These agents leverage LLMs to perform a wide range of tasks, from generating sales leads to making investment decisions. However, the choice of framework for building these agents can significantly affect their efficiency and effectiveness. In this blog, we will evaluate three prominent frameworks for building AI agents — LangGraph, Autogen, and Crew AI — to help you make an informed choice.\\nBy the way, we are constantly sharing our insights on agents. Don\\'t miss out on other pieces in the Mastering Agents series.\\n\\nTypes of agents\\nLangGraph Vs Autogen Vs Crew AI\\nHow to evaluate agents\\nLearn to fix agents\\nTop agent benchmarks\\nMetrics for chatbot agents\\n\\nWhat is an Agent?\\nAn agent in AI is a software application that uses LLMs to perform specific tasks autonomously. These tasks can range from answering research questions to invoking backend services. Agents can be particularly useful in scenarios requiring open-ended answers, where they can provide surprisingly effective solutions.\\nCustomer support agents are capable of addressing customer inquiries, supplying information, and autonomously resolving issues. While code generation agents can generate, debug, and run code snippets, assisting developers in automating repetitive tasks.\\n\\n\\nAutoDev: Automated AI-Driven Development\\nWhen to Use Agents\\nAgents are highly beneficial when tasks require complex decision-making, autonomy, and adaptability. They excel in environments where the workflow is dynamic and involves multiple steps or interactions that can benefit from automation. For instance, in customer support, agents can handle a wide range of queries, provide real-time assistance, and escalate issues to human operators when necessary. This not only improves efficiency but also enhances the customer experience by providing timely and accurate responses.\\nIn research and data analysis, agents can autonomously gather, process, and analyze large volumes of data, providing valuable insights without human intervention. They are also useful in scenarios requiring real-time data processing, such as financial trading, where agents can make split-second decisions based on market conditions.\\nMoreover, agents are beneficial in educational applications, where they can provide personalized learning experiences, adapt to the student\\'s pace, and offer instant feedback. In software development, agents can assist in code generation, debugging, and testing, significantly reducing development time and improving code quality. The ability of agents to learn from interactions and improve over time makes them invaluable in environments where continuous improvement and adaptation are crucial.\\nWhen Not to Use Agents\\nAgents offer numerous advantages but there are scenarios where their use may not be the right choice.\\nTo be clear, in scenarios where tasks are straightforward, infrequent, or require minimal automation, the complexity of implementing agents may not be justified. Simple tasks that existing software solutions can easily manage do not necessarily benefit from the added complexity of agent-based systems. In such cases, traditional methods are more efficient and cost-effective.\\nAdditionally, tasks that require deep domain-specific knowledge and expertise, which cannot be easily encoded into an agent, may not benefit from automation. For instance, complex legal analysis, intricate medical diagnoses, or high-stakes decision-making in uncertain environments often require the expertise and intuition of seasoned professionals. In such cases, relying solely on agents can lead to suboptimal or even harmful outcomes.\\nAgents are also not well-suited for tasks that require a high level of human empathy, creativity, or subjective judgment. For example, in fields such as psychotherapy, counseling, or creative writing, the nuances of human emotions and creativity are difficult for agents to replicate. In these cases, human interaction is irreplaceable and essential for achieving the desired outcomes.\\nImplementing agents requires a significant investment in terms of time, resources, and expertise. For small businesses or projects with limited budgets, the cost of developing and maintaining agents may outweigh the benefits. Furthermore, in highly regulated industries, the use of agents may be restricted due to compliance and security concerns. Ensuring that agents adhere to stringent regulatory requirements can be challenging and resource-intensive.\\nLangGraph vs Autogen vs Crew AI\\nHaving clarified when to utilize an agent, let’s shift our focus to the primary topic: the most widely adopted frameworks in the industry.

It extends the LangChain library, allowing you to coordinate multiple chains (or actors) across multiple steps of computation in a cyclic manner. In this article, we’ll introduce LangGraph, walk you through its basic concepts, and share some insights and common points of confusion for beginners.\\nWhat is LangGraph?\\nLangGraph is a library built on top of LangChain, designed to add cyclic computational capabilities to your LLM applications. While LangChain allows you to define chains of computation (Directed Acyclic Graphs or DAGs), LangGraph introduces the ability to add cycles, enabling more complex, agent-like behaviors where you can call an LLM in a loop, asking it what action to take next.\\nKey Concepts\\nA Simple Example\\nLet’s walk through a simple example where we use LangGraph to classify user input as either a “greeting” or a “search” query and respond accordingly.\\nStep 1: Define the Graph State\\nFirst, we define the state structure for our graph. In this example, our state includes the user’s question, the classification of the question, and a response.\\nStep 2: Create the Graph\\nNext, we create a new instance of StateGraph with our GraphState structure.\\nStep 3: Define Nodes\\nWe define nodes for classifying the input, handling greetings, and handling search queries.\\nStep 4: Add Nodes to the Graph\\nWe add our nodes to the graph and define the flow using edges and conditional edges.\\nStep 5: Set Entry and End Points\\nWe set the entry point for our graph and define the end points.\\nStep 6: Compile and Run the Graph\\nFinally, we compile our graph and run it with some input.\\nCommon Confusions\\nConclusion\\nLangGraph is a versatile tool for building complex, stateful applications with LLMs. By understanding its core concepts and working through simple examples, beginners can start to leverage its power for their projects. Remember to pay attention to state management, conditional edges, and ensuring there are no dead-end nodes in your graph.

See the Python repo and the Python docs.\\n\\nOverview\\nLangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs, used to create agent and multi-agent workflows. Check out an introductory tutorial here.\\nLangGraph is inspired by Pregel and Apache Beam. The public interface draws inspiration from NetworkX. LangGraph is built by LangChain Inc, the creators of LangChain, but can be used without LangChain.\\nWhy use LangGraph?\\nLangGraph powers production-grade agents, trusted by Linkedin, Uber, Klarna, GitLab, and many more. LangGraph provides fine-grained control over both the flow and state of your agent applications. It implements a central persistence layer, enabling features that are common to most agent architectures:\\n\\nMemory: LangGraph persists arbitrary aspects of your application\\'s state, supporting memory of conversations and other updates within and across user interactions;\\nHuman-in-the-loop: Because state is checkpointed, execution can be interrupted and resumed, allowing for decisions, validation, and corrections at key stages via human input.\\n\\nStandardizing these components allows individuals and teams to focus on the behavior of their agent, instead of its supporting infrastructure.\\nThrough LangGraph Platform, LangGraph also provides tooling for the development, deployment, debugging, and monitoring of your applications.\\nLangGraph integrates seamlessly with LangChain and LangSmith (but does not require them).\\nTo learn more about LangGraph, check out our first LangChain Academy course, Introduction to LangGraph, available for free here.\\nLangGraph Platform\\nLangGraph Platform is infrastructure for deploying LangGraph agents. It is a commercial solution for deploying agentic applications to production, built on the open-source LangGraph framework. The LangGraph Platform consists of several components that work together to support the development, deployment, debugging, and monitoring of LangGraph applications: LangGraph Server (APIs), LangGraph SDKs (clients for the APIs), LangGraph CLI (command line tool for building the server), and LangGraph Studio (UI/debugger).\\nSee deployment options here (includes a free tier).\\nHere are some common issues that arise in complex deployments, which LangGraph Platform addresses:\\n\\nStreaming support: LangGraph Server provides multiple streaming modes optimized for various application needs\\nBackground runs: Runs agents asynchronously in the background\\nSupport for long running agents: Infrastructure that can handle long running processes\\nDouble texting: Handle the case where you get two messages from the user before the agent can respond\\nHandle burstiness: Task queue for ensuring requests are handled consistently without loss, even under heavy loads\\n\\nInstallation\\nshell\\nnpm install @langchain/langgraph @langchain/core\\nExample\\nLet\\'s build a tool-calling ReAct-style agent that uses a search tool!\\nshell\\nnpm install @langchain/anthropic zod\\nshell\\nexport ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...\\nOptionally, we can set up LangSmith for best-in-class observability.\\nshell\\nexport LANGSMITH_TRACING=trueexport LANGSMITH_API_KEY=lsv2_sk_...\\nThe simplest way to create a tool-calling agent in LangGraph is to use createReactAgent:\\nHigh-level implementation\\nts\\nimport { createReactAgent } from \"@langchain/langgraph/prebuilt\";import { MemorySaver } from \"@langchain/langgraph\";import { ChatAnthropic } from \"@langchain/anthropic\";import { tool } from \"@langchain/core/tools\";import { z } from \"zod\";// Define the tools for the agent to useconst search = tool(async ({ query }) => {  // This is a placeholder, but don\\'t tell the LLM that...  if (query.toLowerCase().includes(\"sf\") || query.toLowerCase().includes(\"san francisco\")) {    return \"It\\'s 60 degrees and foggy.\"  }  return \"It\\'s 90 degrees and sunny.\"}, {  name: \"search\",  description: \"Call to surf the web.\",  schema: z.object({    query: z.string().describe(\"The query to use in your search.\"),  }),});const tools = [search];const model =  new ChatAnthropic({  model: \"claude-3-5-sonnet-latest\"});// Initialize memory to persist state between graph runsconst checkpointer = new MemorySaver();const app = createReactAgent({  llm: model,  tools,  checkpointSaver: checkpointer,});// Use the agentconst result = await app.invoke(  {    messages: [{      role: \"user\",      content: \"what is the weather in sf\"    }]  },  { configurable: { thread_id: 42 } });console.log(result.messages.at(-1)?.content);\\n\"Based on the search results, it\\'s currently 60 degrees Fahrenheit and foggy in San Francisco, which is quite typical weather for the city.\"\\nNow when we pass the same \"thread_id\", the conversation context is retained via the saved state (i.e. stored list of messages)\\nts\\nconst followup = await app.invoke(  {    messages: [{      role: \"user\",      content: \"what about ny\"    }]  },  { configurable: { thread_id: 42 } });console.log(followup.messages.at(-1)?.content);\\n\"According to the search results, it\\'s currently 90 degrees Fahrenheit and sunny in New York City. That\\'s quite a warm day for New York!\"\\n\\n[!TIP] LangGraph is a low-level framework that allows you to implement any custom agent architectures. Click on the low-level implementation below to see how to implement a tool-calling agent from scratch.\\n\\nLow-level implementation\\nts\\nimport { AIMessage, BaseMessage, HumanMessage } from \"@langchain/core/messages\";import { tool } from \"@langchain/core/tools\";import { z } from \"zod\";import { ChatAnthropic } from \"@langchain/anthropic\";import { StateGraph } from \"@langchain/langgraph\";import { MemorySaver, Annotation, messagesStateReducer } from \"@langchain/langgraph\";import { ToolNode } from \"@langchain/langgraph/prebuilt\";// Define the graph state// See here for more info: https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/how-tos/define-state/const StateAnnotation = Annotation.Root({  messages: Annotation<BaseMessage[]>({    // `messagesStateReducer` function defines how `messages` state key should be updated    // (in this case it appends new messages to the list and overwrites messages with the same ID)    reducer: messagesStateReducer,  }),});// Define the tools for the agent to useconst weatherTool = tool(async ({ query }) => {  // This is a placeholder for the actual implementation  if (query.toLowerCase().includes(\"sf\") || query.toLowerCase().includes(\"san francisco\")) {    return \"It\\'s 60 degrees and foggy.\"  }  return \"It\\'s 90 degrees and sunny.\"}, {  name: \"weather\",  description:    \"Call to get the current weather for a location.\",  schema: z.object({    query: z.string().describe(\"The query to use in your search.\"),  }),});const tools = [weatherTool];const toolNode = new ToolNode(tools);const model = new ChatAnthropic({  model: \"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\",  temperature: 0,}).bindTools(tools);// Define the function that determines whether to continue or not// We can extract the state typing via `StateAnnotation.State`function shouldContinue(state: typeof StateAnnotation.State) {  const messages = state.messages;  const lastMessage = messages[messages.length - 1] as AIMessage;  // If the LLM makes a tool call, then we route to the \"tools\" node  if (lastMessage.tool_calls?.length) {    return \"tools\";  }  // Otherwise, we stop (reply to the user)  return \"__end__\";}// Define the function that calls the modelasync function callModel(state: typeof StateAnnotation.State) {  const messages = state.messages;  const response = await model.invoke(messages);  // We return a list, because this will get added to the existing list  return { messages: [response] };}// Define a new graphconst workflow = new StateGraph(StateAnnotation)  .addNode(\"agent\", callModel)  .addNode(\"tools\", toolNode)  .addEdge(\"__start__\", \"agent\")  .addConditionalEdges(\"agent\", shouldContinue)  .addEdge(\"tools\", \"agent\");// Initialize memory to persist state between graph runsconst checkpointer = new MemorySaver();// Finally, we compile it!// This compiles it into a LangChain Runnable.// Note that we\\'re (optionally) passing the memory when compiling the graphconst app = workflow.compile({ checkpointer });// Use the Runnableconst finalState = await app.invoke(  { messages: [new HumanMessage(\"what is the weather in sf\")] },  { configurable: { thread_id: \"42\" } });console.log(finalState.messages[finalState.messages.length - 1].content);\\nStep-by-step Breakdown:\\nInitialize the model and tools.\\n\\nWe use ChatAnthropic as our LLM. NOTE: we need to make sure the model knows that it has these tools available to call. We can do this by converting the LangChain tools into the format for OpenAI tool calling using the .bindTools() method.\\nWe define the tools we want to use - a search tool in our case. It is really easy to create your own tools - see documentation here on how to do that here.\\n\\nInitialize graph with state.\\n\\nWe initialize the graph (StateGraph) by passing state schema with a reducer that defines how the state should be updated. In our case, we want to append new messages to the list and overwrite messages with the same ID, so we use the prebuilt messagesStateReducer.\\n\\nDefine graph nodes.There are two main nodes we need:\\n\\nThe agent node: responsible for deciding what (if any) actions to take.\\nThe tools node that invokes tools: if the agent decides to take an action, this node will then execute that action.\\n\\nDefine entry point and graph edges.First, we need to set the entry point for graph execution - agent node.\\nThen we define one normal and one conditional edge. Conditional edge means that the destination depends on the contents of the graph\\'s state. In our case, the destination is not known until the agent (LLM) decides.\\n\\nConditional edge: after the agent is called, we should either:\\na. Run tools if the agent said to take an action, OR\\nb. Finish (respond to the user) if the agent did not ask to run tools\\n\\n\\nNormal edge: after the tools are invoked, the graph should always return to the agent to decide what to do next\\n\\nCompile the graph.\\n\\nWhen we compile the graph, we turn it into a LangChain Runnable, which automatically enables calling .invoke(), .stream() and .batch() with your inputs\\nWe can also optionally pass checkpointer object for persisting state between graph runs, and enabling memory, human-in-the-loop workflows, time travel and more. In our case we use MemorySaver - a simple in-memory checkpointer\\n\\nExecute the graph.\\n\\nLangGraph adds the input message to the internal state, then passes the state to the entrypoint node, \"agent\".\\nThe \"agent\" node executes, invoking the chat model.\\nThe chat model returns an AIMessage. LangGraph adds this to the state.\\nGraph cycles the following steps until there are no more tool_calls on AIMessage:\\nIf AIMessage has tool_calls, \"tools\" node executes\\nThe \"agent\" node executes again and returns AIMessage\\n\\n\\nExecution progresses to the special END value and outputs the final state. And as a result, we get a list of all our chat messages as output.\\n\\nDocumentation\\n\\nTutorials: Learn to build with LangGraph through guided examples.\\nHow-to Guides: Accomplish specific things within LangGraph, from streaming, to adding memory & persistence, to common design patterns (branching, subgraphs, etc.), these are the place to go if you want to copy and run a specific code snippet.\\nConceptual Guides: In-depth explanations of the key concepts and principles behind LangGraph, such as nodes, edges, state and more.\\nAPI Reference: Review important classes and methods, simple examples of how to use the graph and checkpointing APIs, higher-level prebuilt components and more.\\nLangGraph Platform: LangGraph Platform is a commercial solution for deploying agentic applications in production, built on the open-source LangGraph framework.\\n\\nResources\\n\\nBuilt with LangGraph: Hear how industry leaders use LangGraph to ship powerful, production-ready AI applications.\\n\\nContributing\\nFor more information on how to contribute, see here.\\nSettings\\nMember Visibility\\n\\nProtected\\nPrivate\\nInherited\\nExternal\\n\\nTheme\\nOn This Page\\n🦜🕸️LangGraph.js\\n\\nOverview\\n\\n\\nWhy use LangGraph?\\nLangGraph Platform\\n\\n\\nInstallation\\nExample\\nDocumentation\\nResources\\nContributing\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n\\nLoading...\\n\\nGenerated using TypeDoc'}, {'title': 'LangGraph - LangChain', 'url': 'https://www.langchain.com/langgraph', 'content': \"Build and scale agentic applications with LangGraph Platform.

These agents leverage LLMs to perform a wide range of tasks, from generating sales leads to making investment decisions. However, the choice of framework for building these agents can significantly affect their efficiency and effectiveness. In this blog, we will evaluate three prominent frameworks for building AI agents — LangGraph, Autogen, and Crew AI — to help you make an informed choice.\\nBy the way, we are constantly sharing our insights on agents. Don\\'t miss out on other pieces in the Mastering Agents series.\\n\\nTypes of agents\\nLangGraph Vs Autogen Vs Crew AI\\nHow to evaluate agents\\nLearn to fix agents\\nTop agent benchmarks\\nMetrics for chatbot agents\\n\\nWhat is an Agent?\\nAn agent in AI is a software application that uses LLMs to perform specific tasks autonomously. These tasks can range from answering research questions to invoking backend services. Agents can be particularly useful in scenarios requiring open-ended answers, where they can provide surprisingly effective solutions.\\nCustomer support agents are capable of addressing customer inquiries, supplying information, and autonomously resolving issues. While code generation agents can generate, debug, and run code snippets, assisting developers in automating repetitive tasks.\\n\\n\\nAutoDev: Automated AI-Driven Development\\nWhen to Use Agents\\nAgents are highly beneficial when tasks require complex decision-making, autonomy, and adaptability. They excel in environments where the workflow is dynamic and involves multiple steps or interactions that can benefit from automation. For instance, in customer support, agents can handle a wide range of queries, provide real-time assistance, and escalate issues to human operators when necessary. This not only improves efficiency but also enhances the customer experience by providing timely and accurate responses.\\nIn research and data analysis, agents can autonomously gather, process, and analyze large volumes of data, providing valuable insights without human intervention. They are also useful in scenarios requiring real-time data processing, such as financial trading, where agents can make split-second decisions based on market conditions.\\nMoreover, agents are beneficial in educational applications, where they can provide personalized learning experiences, adapt to the student\\'s pace, and offer instant feedback. In software development, agents can assist in code generation, debugging, and testing, significantly reducing development time and improving code quality. The ability of agents to learn from interactions and improve over time makes them invaluable in environments where continuous improvement and adaptation are crucial.\\nWhen Not to Use Agents\\nAgents offer numerous advantages but there are scenarios where their use may not be the right choice.\\nTo be clear, in scenarios where tasks are straightforward, infrequent, or require minimal automation, the complexity of implementing agents may not be justified. Simple tasks that existing software solutions can easily manage do not necessarily benefit from the added complexity of agent-based systems. In such cases, traditional methods are more efficient and cost-effective.\\nAdditionally, tasks that require deep domain-specific knowledge and expertise, which cannot be easily encoded into an agent, may not benefit from automation. For instance, complex legal analysis, intricate medical diagnoses, or high-stakes decision-making in uncertain environments often require the expertise and intuition of seasoned professionals. In such cases, relying solely on agents can lead to suboptimal or even harmful outcomes.\\nAgents are also not well-suited for tasks that require a high level of human empathy, creativity, or subjective judgment. For example, in fields such as psychotherapy, counseling, or creative writing, the nuances of human emotions and creativity are difficult for agents to replicate. In these cases, human interaction is irreplaceable and essential for achieving the desired outcomes.\\nImplementing agents requires a significant investment in terms of time, resources, and expertise. For small businesses or projects with limited budgets, the cost of developing and maintaining agents may outweigh the benefits. Furthermore, in highly regulated industries, the use of agents may be restricted due to compliance and security concerns. Ensuring that agents adhere to stringent regulatory requirements can be challenging and resource-intensive.\\nLangGraph vs Autogen vs Crew AI\\nHaving clarified when to utilize an agent, let’s shift our focus to the primary topic: the most widely adopted frameworks in the industry. We conducted a poll and identified three frameworks that are most commonly used. Let’s begin with a high-level overview of these frameworks.\\n\\n\\nLangGraph\\nLangGraph is an open-source framework designed by Langchain to build stateful, multi-actor applications using LLMs. Inspired by the long history of representing data processing pipelines as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), LangGraph treats workflows as graphs where each node represents a specific task or function.

This includes hierarchical, sequential, and dynamic interaction patterns.\\nGrouping tools and responsibilities can yield better results, as an agent is more likely to succeed on a focused task than if it has to select from dozens of tools. Separate prompts can also enhance performance, allowing each prompt to have its own instructions and few-shot examples. Each agent can even be powered by a separate fine-tuned LLM, providing a helpful conceptual model for development. This approach allows for evaluating and improving each agent individually without disrupting the larger application.\\nLangGraph: LangGraph supports various multi-agent patterns, including hierarchical and dynamic group chats. It allows users to define complex interaction patterns between agents. The framework\\'s graph-based approach makes it easy to visualize and manage these interactions. LangGraph prefers an approach where you explicitly define different agents and transition probabilities, representing them as nodes in a graph. This graphical approach provides the highest flexibility for constructing complex and opinionated workflows, where controlling the transition probabilities between nodes is crucial.\\nAutogen: Autogen emerged as one of the first multi-agent frameworks, framing workflows more as \"conversations\" between agents. This conversational approach provides flexibility in defining how agents interact with each other, supporting multiple conversation patterns, including sequential and nested chats. Autogen\\'s design makes it easy to manage complex multi-agent interactions, allowing agents to collaborate effectively..\\nCrew AI: Crew AI supports role-based interactions and autonomous delegation between agents. It provides processes like sequential and hierarchical task execution to manage multi-agent interactions effectively. This ensures that agents can work together efficiently to achieve common goals. Crew AI is a higher-level framework compared to LangGraph, focusing on creating multi-agent \"teams\" that operate cohesively.\\n\\nWinner: LangGraph has an edge due to its graph-based approach, which makes it easier to visualize and manage complex interactions.\\n\\nCaching\\nCaching is useful in reducing latency and resource consumption of agents by storing and reusing previously computed results.\\nLangGraph: LangGraph supports caching through its built-in persistence layer. This allows users to save and resume graph execution at any point. The caching mechanism ensures that previously computed results can be reused, improving performance.\\nAutogen: AutoGen supports caching API requests so that they can be reused when the same request is issued.\\nCrew AI: All tools in Crew AI support caching, enabling agents to efficiently reuse previously obtained results, reducing the load on external resources and speeding up the execution time. You can also define finer control over the caching mechanism using the cache_function attribute of the tool.\\n\\nWinner: All of the frameworks support caching but LangGraph and CrewAI might have an edge.\\n\\nReplay\\nReplay functionality allows users to revisit and analyze previous interactions, which is useful for debugging and improving agent performance. It enables users to understand the decision-making process and identify areas for improvement.\\nLangGraph: LangGraph supports replay through its time travel feature. Users can rewind and explore alternative paths, making it easier to debug and experiment with different scenarios. This feature provides a detailed history of interactions, allowing for thorough analysis.\\nAutogen: Autogen does not have an explicit replay feature, but users can manually update the state to control the agent\\'s trajectory. This allows for some level of replay functionality, although it may require more manual intervention.\\nCrew AI: CrewAI provides the ability to replay from a task specified from the latest crew kickoff. Currently, only the latest kickoff is supported and it will only allow you to replay from the most recent crew run.\\n\\nWinner: LangGraph and Crew AI both make it easy to replay with inbuilt capabilities.\\n\\nCode Execution\\nCode execution capabilities enable agents to perform complex tasks by writing and executing code. This is particularly useful for tasks that require dynamic calculations or interactions with external systems.\\nLangGraph: LangGraph supports code execution through its integration with LangChain.

A mental model difference highlighted by the LangChain team: Autogen frames multi-agent as a free-form conversation, whereas LangGraph frames it as an explicit graph of states/transitions, which can be more intuitive for complex, non-linear workflows. For example, the supervisor looks at the user’s request and decides which agent node (e.g. web_researcher or database_agent) should handle it next, then issues a Command that effectively hands off execution to that agent node (see Multi-Agent System Tutorial with LangGraph).', 'score': 0.85797083, 'raw_content': 'Published Time: 2025-02-07T19:12:48.543Z\\nTechnical Comparison of AutoGen, CrewAI, LangGraph, and OpenAI Swarm | by Omar Santos | Feb, 2025 | Artificial Intelligence in Plain English\\nOpen in app\\nSign up\\nSign in\\n\\nWrite\\n\\nSign up\\nSign in\\n\\nTechnical Comparison of AutoGen, CrewAI, LangGraph, and OpenAI Swarm\\n\\n\\nOmar Santos\\n·Follow\\nPublished in\\nArtificial Intelligence in Plain English\\n·\\n43 min read\\n·\\nFeb 7, 2025\\n\\n--\\n\\nListen\\nShare\\nThis is a detailed technical comparison of AutoGen, CrewAI, LangGraph, and OpenAI’s Swarm, analyzing their architecture, development experience, technical capabilities, integration, deployment, and practical considerations. I used Deep Research and then edited the items that needed to be improved. I learned a lot based on this “research” activity. Hope this is useful for you.\\nSpoiler alert:\\n\\nCore Architectures\\nAutoGen (Microsoft)\\nAutoGen adopts a layered, event-driven architecture that includes asynchronous agent conversations (see: AutoGen v0.4: Reimagining the foundation of agentic AI for scale, extensibility, and robustness — Microsoft Research).\\nIt consists of a core layer for fundamental event handling, an AgentChat layer providing high-level chat and code-execution APIs, and extensible integration layers for tools and models. The design pattern is conversation-centric — tasks are modeled as chats between agents (e.g. an Assistant and a UserProxy) rather than explicit workflows (like LangGraph: Multi-Agent Workflows). This makes AutoGen feel like orchestrating multiple ChatGPT-like agents talking to each other.\\nAgents in AutoGen communicate via asynchronous message passing. The framework supports both request/response interactions and event-driven triggers. An agent is an instance of a ConversableAgent (or subclass like AssistantAgent or UserProxyAgent) that can send and receive messages from other agents (see: Multi-agent Conversation Framework | AutoGen 0.2). All inter-agent communication occurs through these message exchanges – messages are the sole medium for agents to converse and coordinate. This protocol allows dynamic multi-turn dialogs where agents can proactively message others when certain events occur (for example, one agent producing a piece of code can trigger another agent to execute it).\\nState Management\\nAutoGen maintains conversation state implicitly through message history. Each agent holds context from prior messages in the chat session (short-term memory), ensuring continuity of conversation. In AutoGen v0.4, the introduction of an asynchronous event loop means the framework can handle multiple pending events (messages) and agent actions concurrently, improving scalability (see: AutoGen v0.4: Reimagining the foundation of agentic AI for scale, extensibility, and robustness — Microsoft Research).\\nThe state (e.g. which agents are active, pending tasks) is managed by the core event dispatcher. AutoGen also enables mid-execution intervention — developers can pause a running conversation, inspect/modify state, then resume — providing fine control over the state of multi-agent workflows.\\nMemory Handling\\nBy default, each conversation’s transcript serves as memory for context. AutoGen agents thus remember prior dialogue up to token limits, but v0.4 adds pluggable memory components for more advanced use. For example, one can attach short-term memory buffers, long-term vector stores, or knowledge bases to agents. AutoGen 0.2 introduced a Mem0 module supporting long-term, short-term, semantic, and episodic memory for agents (see Agent with memory using Mem0 | AutoGen 0.2).\\nHowever, out-of-the-box, AutoGen’s memory is conversational – context is maintained through the message history to keep responses coherent. It doesn’t impose explicit memory architectures like graphs; rather, it relies on the LLM’s context window and any integrated memory tool the developer adds.\\nEvent Processing Pipeline\\nAutoGen’s pipeline is asynchronous and event-driven. When an agent sends a message or triggers an action, an event is emitted to the core scheduler which routes it to the target agent(s). In a typical two-agent chat, for example, the UserProxyAgent initiate_chat() sends an initial message to an AssistantAgent. The assistant then generates a reply (possibly containing a code block or tool request), which is sent back as an event to the user agent. The user agent can execute code or involve a human if configured, then send the result as another message. This loop continues until a termination condition is reached (e.g. the user agent decides the task is solved). AutoGen v0.4 supports both direct request/response cycles and background event handling, enabling long-running agents that wait for triggers. The architecture’s non-blocking design allows multiple conversations or agent pairs to progress in parallel, constrained only by available compute and API throughput.\\nCrewAI\\nCrewAI’s architecture is built around the metaphor of a “crew” of agents working as a team. It introduces a unique Crews and Flows design pattern (see their GitHub repo). A Crew is a collection of role-defined agents plus a set of tasks for them, and a Process Flow defines how those tasks are executed (e.g. sequentially or in parallel). This provides an explicit concept of a structured process, something that Autogen’s free-form chats lack.\\nIn practice, the framework is Python-based and leverages LangChain under the hood for LLM calls and tools integration (see AI Agents Tools: LangGraph vs Autogen vs Crew AI vs OpenAI Swarm- Key Differences — DEV Community), but it abstracts complexity by offering high-level constructs: each Agent has a role, goal, and optional backstory, and each Task assigns an agent to a specific objective. The design encourages role-based specialization – for instance, one agent might be a “Researcher” and another a “Writer,” each focusing on different subtasks.\\nAgent Communication: CrewAI agents cooperate primarily through structured task hand-offs rather than arbitrary message passing. In the current version, the only built-in process type is sequential execution. This means one agent runs to complete its task and produce output, then the next agent gets that output as input to its task. The framework automates the passing of context between agents in sequence. There isn’t a generic message-passing bus as in AutoGen; instead, communication is orchestrated by the Crew controller: after each task, the Crew collates the result (usually the agent’s output text) and injects it into the prompt of the next agent’s task as context. This yields a deterministic pipeline of agent-to-agent interaction. For more complex coordination (like agents conversing back and forth), developers would have to implement custom flows or use the replay mechanism.\\nHowever, CrewAI’s philosophy is “role-playing conversation” — agents fulfill their roles in a turn-taking manner to collectively achieve a goal.\\nState Management\\nCrewAI maintains an internal state for each Crew run, tracking task progress and any shared data (such as the output from prior tasks). Since tasks are executed sequentially (in the current Process model), state management is simpler: the framework can store the result of Task1 and provide it to Task2, and so on.\\nThe Crew.kickoff() method runs the sequence and can return a final aggregated result or the state containing all intermediate outputs. CrewAI also supports structured outputs (via JSON or Pydantic models) for tasks. This implies it can enforce a certain state schema, making it easier to persist or interpret the state after execution. If needed, developers can insert custom logic (Python functions) between tasks or use conditional branching (the framework’s documentation mentions plans for more process types, though sequential is currently default). Overall, state is managed in a high-level way – the developer thinks in terms of task outcomes rather than raw message logs.\\nMemory Handling\\nCrewAI implements a comprehensive memory system comparable to LangGraph’s. Each agent can have memory of past interactions or knowledge relevant to its role. Because tasks are typically one-off in a sequence, memory in CrewAI often means that an agent can recall what it discussed in its portion of the workflow. For example, if the Researcher agent finds facts in Task1, the Writer agent in Task2 can be given those facts (from Task1 output) as context — effectively short-term memory transfer. CrewAI likely leverages LangChain’s memory modules under the hood for any long-term memory needs (e.g., vector stores or conversation buffers), although details are abstracted from the user. The key is that CrewAI facilitates persistent context across the crew’s workflow, enabling agents to maintain context from previous steps. Additionally, each agent’s backstory or persona acts as a static memory influencing its responses. If a CrewAI agent uses tools or looks up information, those results can be fed into its prompt as needed. In short, contextual continuity is preserved by design: the framework passes prior task outputs forward so agents work with cumulative knowledge.\\nEvent Processing Pipeline\\nThe execution pipeline in CrewAI is more linear and procedure-driven. When crew.kickoff() is invoked, the framework iterates through the defined tasks in the specified process order. For each task, it formulates a prompt for the assigned agent (including the task description and any available context from prior tasks), calls the LLM (or tool) to get the agent’s output, then captures the result. After one agent finishes, there’s a hand-off where the next agent’s prompt is prepared using the latest state. There isn’t an event bus or asynchronous loop – it’s a straightforward loop over tasks unless a task itself spawns sub-actions. CrewAI does have a Replay feature to revisit or debug recent runs, which suggests it can log each step’s inputs/outputs. If a failure or exception occurs in a task, the pipeline likely halts or that error is returned, and the developer can modify the task or prompt and rerun (or use the replay to fix and continue from that point). In essence, CrewAI’s pipeline is akin to a scripted play: each agent “actor” performs in turn, directed by the Crew, and the entire performance is logged for review or repetition as needed.\\nLangGraph (LangChain’s Agentic Framework)\\nInternal Design: LangGraph is fundamentally built around directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to model agent workflows. Each node in the graph represents an operation or an agent action, and edges define the flow of control and data. This graph-based orchestration provides explicit control over complex interactions that would be hard to manage in a pure conversation. The design pattern is closer to a state machine or workflow engine for LLM agents (see LangGraph: Multi-Agent Workflows). For example, you might have a graph where Node1 is an agent that parses a user query, Node2 is a different agent that does a web search, and Node3 aggregates results — with edges controlling that Node2 executes after Node1, etc. LangGraph leverages the broader LangChain ecosystem; it’s integrated such that each graph node can utilize LangChain tools, memory, or chains.\\nThe architecture is highly extensible: developers can add custom node functions (even Python code) and define conditional transitions. This yields unparalleled control for multi-step, branched workflows, at the cost of some upfront complexity (you must design the graph). A mental model difference highlighted by the LangChain team: Autogen frames multi-agent as a free-form conversation, whereas LangGraph frames it as an explicit graph of states/transitions, which can be more intuitive for complex, non-linear workflows.\\nAgent Communication\\nIn LangGraph, agents communicate indirectly via the shared graph state. There isn’t a direct messaging channel between agents as in AutoGen; instead, each agent writes its output to the graph’s state, which subsequent agents (nodes) can read. Essentially, when an agent node runs, it can append to a **MessagesState** (a structured record of messages or data) that is accessible globally or to connected nodes. One common pattern is to use a “Supervisor” agent node that routes control to different specialist agents based on the content of the state (this is analogous to a triage).\\nFor example, the supervisor looks at the user’s request and decides which agent node (e.g. web_researcher or database_agent) should handle it next, then issues a Command that effectively hands off execution to that agent node (see Multi-Agent System Tutorial with LangGraph). This is done by returning a goto directive (like Command(goto=\"web_researcher\")) in the supervisor’s node function, which the LangGraph engine interprets as “activate the Web Researcher node next.” In summary, agent-to-agent communication is orchestrated by the graph: agents don’t call each other directly but rather the workflow logic (edges and routing nodes) ensures each agent’s output becomes the next agent’s input. This design allows for complex communication patterns (loops, branches, parallel paths) that are explicit in the graph structure rather than emergent from agent prompts.\\nState Management\\nLangGraph maintains a global shared state object (often called MessagesState or similar) that contains information accumulated throughout the workflow. This state typically includes a list of messages or results from each node. All nodes can read from and write to this state, making it the medium for memory and context passing.\\nThe framework supports marking certain data as start or end of conversation, and the graph can have designated start and end nodes (ENTRY and END). Importantly, LangGraph offers built-in persistence for state: one can store the state of a graph (to a database or file) and resume later. This is useful for long-running or persistent agent applications (e.g. agents that work over days).\\nThe state machine approach also means developers can checkpoint states and implement error recovery by rolling back to a previous state (“time travel”). Because of this, error handling and branching logic can be part of the graph – e.g. an edge that goes to a recovery node if another node outputs an error. In summary, LangGraph’s state management is explicit and robust: it’s stateful by design, with every node transition potentially updating the shared memory and the ability to persist/restore that state as needed.\\nMemory Handling\\nLangGraph boasts comprehensive memory support. By default, an agent node in a LangGraph is stateless between runs, but the framework provides mechanisms for both short-term memory (within a single session) and long-term memory across sessions. Short-term memory is naturally handled by the shared state — as agents add to the messages list, that serves as a conversation log that subsequent agents can see (much like a context buffer). For long-term memory, LangGraph can integrate with external memory stores; notably, it can plug into Zep (a long-term memory service) to automatically store and retrieve facts from past interactions (see LangGraph Tutorial: Building LLM Agents with LangChain\\'s Agent Framework).\\nThis allows agents to recall information from prior sessions or earlier in the workflow beyond the immediate context window. Additionally, LangGraph supports entity-specific memory (tracking information about particular entities) and offers caching of node results to avoid recomputation. A standout feature is the “time travel” debug mode, which isn’t memory per se, but lets developers rewind the state and try a different path – effectively leveraging stored state snapshots for testing alternative agent behaviors. Together, these features ensure LangGraph agents can have rich, persistent context: short-term memory for coherence in the current run and long-term memory for knowledge retention, making it powerful for large workflows that need context at every step.\\nEvent Processing Pipeline\\nLangGraph’s execution is driven by the flow of control in the graph. When you run a LangGraph agent (or multi-agent workflow), it starts at a defined start node and moves along edges based on conditions and Command outputs. The pipeline can branch and loop: for instance, the Supervisor node might route to Agent A, then after A finishes, control returns to the Supervisor which might route to Agent B, and so on.\\nEach node’s execution can be seen as an event: the node function is called with the current state, it may call an LLM or tool, then it produces an output (updates to state or a Command). That output determines the next event (which node to execute next). LangGraph is capable of parallel execution if the graph has parallel branches (using task queues and worker processes as hinted by its horizontal scaling support), but commonly workflows are defined as DAGs that are executed stepwise. The pipeline includes robust error checking: if a node fails (throws an exception or returns an error), the engine can catch it and either retry (if configured with automated retries) or follow an alternate edge for error handling. Because every transition is explicit, performance monitoring is easier – one can measure time per node, etc., and use LangChain’s LangSmith tooling for observability.\\nIn essence, LangGraph’s pipeline is that of a distributed workflow system for AI: events = node computations, and the graph’s edges dictate the sequence of those events, with full clarity on what happens at each step.\\nOpenAI Swarm\\nOpenAI’s Swarm is a relatively lightweight and minimalist framework for multi-agent orchestration. It’s designed to feel like an extension of the OpenAI Chat Completions API rather than a heavy abstraction. Internally, Swarm revolves around two main primitives: the **Agent** class and the Swarm client (which manages running agents) (see GitHub - openai/swarm).\\nAn Agent in Swarm is essentially a wrapper around a system prompt (called instructions) and a set of available functions (tools) that the agent can use. There’s no complex class hierarchy or multiple layers – an Agent’s behavior is largely defined by the LLM’s responses to its system prompt and function schema. The design encourages defining multiple such Agents and then using handoffs (one agent yielding control to another) to create multi-agent sequences.\\nSwarm does not maintain an overarching controller agent; instead, control flows implicitly via agent hand-offs and function calls. This keeps the architecture simple and “flat.” The guiding philosophy is to be highly customizable with minimal framework overhead – developers manually handle a lot of the logic that heavier frameworks would automate, which gives flexibility at the cost of manual management.\\nAgent Communication\\nIn Swarm, agent-to-agent communication occurs through a mechanism called handoffs. There is no persistent message bus or multi-turn dialog manager; instead, an agent can call a function that returns another agent, signaling that future messages should be “handled” by the returned agent.\\nFor example, Agent A might have a function transfer_to_B() that simply returns Agent B – if the LLM behind Agent A decides to call transfer_to_B, the Swarm client will switch the active agent to B for subsequent interactions. This is essentially how one agent “passes the conversation” to another. All agents share the same conversation log (the list of messages) when handed off, so context carries over. Aside from handoffs, agents communicate by writing into the shared message list: each time an agent produces a reply, that reply (plus any function call results) is appended to the messages history that the next agent will see.\\nIn practice, this looks like a sequence of role-based messages: e.g., User says something, Agent A (role=“assistant” as far as OpenAI API is concerned) responds or calls a function that leads to Agent B taking over, then Agent B generates the next assistant message, and so forth.\\nThe communication protocol is essentially the OpenAI Chat Completion format, augmented with the concept of switching the “system role” (instructions) on the fly via function returns. Unlike the others, Swarm’s agents do not explicitly talk to each other – the Swarm runtime orchestrates the turns based on agent returns, making it a simple but effective protocol for chaining agents together.\\nState Management: Swarm is intentionally stateless between calls — it doesn’t preserve any hidden state outside the message list. The Swarm client’s run() method takes in an initial agent and a list of messages, then returns an updated list of messages and the last active agent. If the developer wants to maintain a conversation, they must keep the returned messages and agent and supply them in the next run() call.\\nThis design mimics the OpenAI API statelessness – each call is independent, except for what you carry over yourself. This means memory and state are fully under the developer’s control: you decide which and how many past messages to include in the next prompt (which is great for flexibility, but requires manual handling). There are context variables that Swarm allows you to pass in (a context_variables dict) when running agents.\\nThese can be used by agent functions (for example, an agent function might use a variable like user_name when constructing a response). If an agent function returns a Result object, it can update these context variables, effectively acting as a scratchpad for state that persists across turns in addition to the messages. But aside from that, Swarm doesn’t implement long-term memory or multi-session state – those would have to be built on top (e.g., by saving conversation histories in a database and reloading them). The simplicity means lower overhead and easier debugging, but the developer must manage state persistence if needed.\\nMemory Handling\\nOut of the box, Swarm relies on the conversation history (messages list) for memory, and by default it does not automatically trim or store long-term memory. The memory each agent has is basically the content of the messages passed to client.run(), up to the context length of the model. If the conversation grows too long (approaching token limits), it’s on the user to truncate or summarize messages. Swarm’s documentation explicitly notes it “does not store state between calls”– aligning with that, it doesn’t provide built-in short-term or long-term memory modules.\\nHowever, because you can incorporate Python functions easily, one can integrate external memory: for instance, you could have a function that queries a vector database (for long-term memory) when the agent needs it. The framework’s minimalism gives you that freedom. Additionally, context variables (as mentioned) offer a lightweight form of memory within a single run(): they can carry values that persist through function calls in one invocation loop.\\nFor example, an agent might set a context variable “department” to “sales” when handing off to a Sales Agent, so that the Sales Agent knows the context. This is more akin to passing parameters than memory though. In summary, Swarm’s memory = messages + any user-implemented storage. It keeps things simple and leaves persistent memory as an exercise for the developer or a higher-level layer.\\nEvent Processing Pipeline\\nThe core loop of Swarm’s client.run() provides a clear picture of its event pipeline:\\n\\n(1) Take the current agent and messages, get an LLM completion for the agent’s response;\\n(2) If the agent’s response includes a function call, execute that function and append the result to messages;\\n(3) If the function call returned another agent (handoff), switch the current agent to that new agent;\\n(4) Update any context variables if the function returned a Result with such updates;\\n(5) Repeat from step 1 with the updated agent, until the model produces no function call (meaning the conversation turn is done), then return the final messages and agent.\\nThis loop is executed synchronously within the run() call. There’s no concurrency – it’s a single-threaded sequence for one conversation turn, though that turn may involve multiple back-and-forth handoffs internally. The Swarm framework itself doesn’t introduce new events beyond what the OpenAI API already handles (messages and function calls). One notable aspect is error handling in the pipeline: if an agent tries to call a function that errors out or is not found, Swarm will catch that and append an error message into the conversation, allowing the agent (or a subsequent agent) to handle it gracefully. This keeps the loop going instead of hard-stopping on a function error. Finally, when run() finishes, the user can decide to call it again (as another event cycle) or end the conversation. To scale, you would typically run multiple run() calls (for different conversations) in parallel threads or processes. Swarm doesn’t manage that for you but doesn’t prevent it either – it’s as scalable as the underlying Python environment and API rate limits allow, thanks to its stateless and simple loop design.\\nDevelopment Experience\\nInstallation and Setup\\nAutoGen: AutoGen is open-source (hosted by Microsoft), installable via pip. The package name is typically autogen (for v0.4) or sometimes referred to as ag2. Installation is straightforward: after ensuring Python 3.8+ (as required by its dependencies), one can pip install autogen. Microsoft provides documentation on GitHub and a research project page (AutoGen - Microsoft Research). The setup may involve obtaining API keys for LLMs (OpenAI API keys, Azure OpenAI, etc.) since AutoGen will need those to power its agents. The AutoGen docs provide an Installation guide covering environment setup and any optional components (for example, installing Docker if you plan to use the code execution agent). Overall, installing AutoGen is reported as smooth, though being a fast-evolving framework, you’ll want to match versions carefully (e.g., v0.2 vs v0.4 have different APIs, with a migration guide available (see AutoGen v0.4: Reimagining the foundation of agentic AI for scale, extensibility, and robustness - Microsoft Research)).\\nCrewAI: CrewAI can be installed via pip as well: pip install crewai will fetch the latest release from PyPI (crewAIInc/crewAI - GitHub). It’s recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts (Installation - CrewAI). If you intend to use CrewAI’s additional tools (like the GitHub search tool, etc.), you can install extras with pip install \"crewai[tools]\" (crewAIInc/crewAI - GitHub). The setup process is relatively simple and documented on the official CrewAI site (crewai.com) and its GitHub README. After installation, using CrewAI involves setting up your OpenAI API key as environment variable or in code (since by default it calls OpenAI’s models). CrewAI doesn’t require running any servers or databases to get started – it’s a pure Python library. The developer, João Moura, also provides example Jupyter notebooks and a quickstart in the repository (crewAI-quickstart/crewai_sequential_quickstart.ipynb at main - GitHub), making the initial setup and first run quite accessible.\\nLangGraph: LangGraph is part of the LangChain ecosystem. As of early 2025, it’s provided as a separate module (langgraph) that can be installed via pip, often alongside langchain itself (Multi-Agent System Tutorial with LangGraph). In a tutorial, the following were installed to get LangGraph working: langgraph, langchain_community, langchain_openai, langchain_experimental, etc., indicating that LangGraph integrates tightly with LangChain’s packages (Multi-Agent System Tutorial with LangGraph). Setting up LangGraph may be slightly more involved because of these dependencies and the need for API keys for various tools (OpenAI keys, and optionally keys for search APIs or vector DBs if used). LangGraph’s creators also offer a managed SaaS platform, but using it locally typically just means installing the library and possibly setting up a persistence backend if you want to use the built-in persistence (for example, a SQLite or other database for storing graph state). The documentation for LangGraph is found on the LangChain website (LangGraph) and a series of blog posts. Because it’s a new addition to LangChain, one might need to ensure both langchain and langgraph versions are compatible and up-to-date.\\nOpenAI Swarm: Swarm is open-source on GitHub (managed by OpenAI’s Solutions Engineering team). At the time of writing, it’s not yet on PyPI as a stable package, but you can install it directly from GitHub with a pip command. For example, the README suggests: pip install git+https://github.com/openai/swarm.git to get the latest version. This requires Python 3.10+. Because Swarm is experimental, you might need to update it frequently by reinstalling from the repo to get the latest fixes. After installation, the setup is trivial: import the swarm module and you’re ready to define agents. You will need an OpenAI API key and the OpenAI Python SDK configured, since Swarm internally instantiates an OpenAI client for you. The absence of extra infrastructure or dependencies (no databases, no web servers needed unless you add them) makes initial setup quick. In short, Swarm’s installation is just grabbing the library, and being minimalistic, it has a low barrier to getting a toy example running.\\nExamples and Tutorials\\nAutoGen: AutoGen comes with a rich set of examples and notebooks. Microsoft has published example use cases like a multi-agent code generation scenario, math problem solving with an assistant and checker, etc. There’s an official examples repository on GitHub (Building LLM-Enabled Multi Agent Applications with AutoGen — GitHub) and the documentation’s “Use Cases” section includes code for a basic two-agent conversation and more advanced patterns (Multi-agent Conversation Framework | AutoGen 0.2). For instance, the docs show how to set up an AssistantAgent and a UserProxyAgent that collaborate to answer a question using code execution Additionally, blog posts (e.g., on Medium) demonstrate AutoGen in real scenarios — one article shows multiple AI agents brainstorming a solution architecture given business requirements (see Multi-Agent Conversation with AutoGen AI | by Tony Siciliani | here on Medium).\\nCrewAI: Being a newer entrant, CrewAI still has a growing collection of examples, but there are already several community-driven tutorials. The CrewAI GitHub repository has a “quickstart” Jupyter notebook that walks through a simple usage (similar to the README example) and more advanced notebooks demonstrating integration with tools (the search results mention a PGSearchTool quickstart, etc.) (crewAI-quickstart/crewai_sequential_quickstart.ipynb at main — GitHub). On Medium, there are articles (including one by the CrewAI creator) comparing CrewAI to other frameworks and showing when to use it (Which AI Agent framework should i use? (CrewAI, Langgraph …). CrewAI’s own documentation site includes code snippets to illustrate key features — e.g., how to use the Flow decorators for branching or how to incorporate a human message in between agents. One of the standout example scenarios for CrewAI is an email automation: a user has shown how to use CrewAI with LangChain and LangGraph to automatically check emails and draft replies (the LangChain blog referenced this integration) (LangGraph: Multi-Agent Workflows). This example underscores CrewAI’s strength in orchestrating multiple steps with different agents. Because CrewAI emphasizes ease of use, the provided examples are often complete but compact – you see how to define agents and tasks in just a few lines, which encourages experimentation. Community resources like a Discord or discussion forum exist (the GitHub README links to a “Talk with the Docs” chatbot to answer questions (GitHub - e-johnstonn/CrewAI)), making it easy to get informal help or see how others are implementing things. In summary, while not as vast as LangChain’s resources, CrewAI has accessible examples that cover common multi-agent workflows and new ones are appearing as the community grows.\\nLangGraph: LangGraph benefits from the extensive content created by LangChain’s community. There are detailed tutorials and even courses on using LangGraph. For example, the FutureSmart AI blog has a multipart tutorial culminating in a “Build a Multi-Agent System with LangGraph” guide of 13 minutes read time, which goes from environment setup to a full implementation with a supervisor agent and specialized worker agents (Multi-Agent System Tutorial with LangGraph) (Multi-Agent System Tutorial with LangGraph). This tutorial shows how to create each agent (web researcher, RAG agent, NL2SQL agent) and connect them in a graph under a supervisor — a complex real-world scenario broken down step by step. Another resource is the LangChain blog which introduced LangGraph with examples, including comparisons to Autogen and CrewAI (LangGraph: Multi-Agent Workflows) (LangGraph: Multi-Agent Workflows). For hands-on learning, the LangChain folks have LangGraph examples in their repository and a webinar/YouTube video (“LangGraph 101”) which live-codes an agent using LangGraph (LangGraph 101: Building Stateful Multi-Agent AI Applications). Additionally, because LangGraph is an official LangChain project, many LangChain users share their LangGraph experiments on forums like the LangChain Discord or Reddit. You’ll find example code for things like using LangGraph for a conversation with tools or integrating LangGraph with LangSmith for monitoring. The abundance of examples is a double-edged sword: there’s a lot to draw from, but you often need to piece together multiple examples to cover all aspects of a complex use case. Still, having third-party blog posts, official docs, and community notebooks means developers are well-supported when trying to implement even very complex workflows in LangGraph.\\nOpenAI Swarm: Swarm, being simpler, doesn’t require very large examples to demonstrate usage — and indeed the repository’s **examples/** directory is full of small, focused examples. For instance, there’s a basic example showing fundamentals like setup and simple handoffs (GitHub - openai/swarm: Educational framework exploring ergonomic, lightweight multi-agent orchestration. Managed by OpenAI Solution team.). The triage_agent example demonstrates how to implement a triage pattern (one agent deciding which specialist agent should handle a user query) (GitHub - openai/swarm: Educational framework exploring ergonomic, lightweight multi-agent orchestration. Managed by OpenAI Solution team.). Another example, airline, simulates an airline customer service with multiple agents handling different types of requests (GitHub - openai/swarm: Educational framework exploring ergonomic, lightweight multi-agent orchestration. Managed by OpenAI Solution team.). Each example comes with a README explaining what it does. These are extremely helpful starting points – you can often copy an example and modify the agent prompts or functions to repurpose it for your needs. Outside of the repo, early adopters have written Medium articles such as “Swarm Agent Framework Initial Exploration” (Swarm Agent Framework Initial Exploration | by Yogendra Sisodia), which walk through the official examples and then tweak them (e.g., modifying the triage example to add more logic). The OpenAI Cookbook has also started to include patterns using Swarm, like orchestrating agents with routines and handoffs in a customer support scenario (Orchestrating Agents: Routines and Handoffs | OpenAI Cookbook). Because Swarm is new, there aren’t as many polished tutorials, but the combination of a clear README and simple code means many developers might not even need more than that. Swarm’s examples highlight unique capabilities like streaming responses and how to properly structure functions for the LLM to call. This ensures that developers can quickly learn best practices (like using docstrings for function descriptions, etc., which Swarm then turns into function schemas.\\nTechnical Capabilities\\nScalability and Agent Limits\\nMaximum Concurrent Agents: None of these frameworks imposes a hard-coded small limit on number of agents, but practical limits and patterns differ. AutoGen can theoretically handle many agents in conversation (it was built with scenarios like multiple expert agents collaborating). In practice, AutoGen examples often feature around 2–5 agents working together (for instance, a “boss”, “coder”, “reviewer”, etc., in a software development scenario). Its asynchronous architecture in v0.4 is explicitly aimed at scaling to larger teams of agents, allowing more concurrent interactions without choking the system. That said, each additional agent in a single conversation adds overhead (more messages, longer context).\\nFor CrewAI, since the current process model is sequential, you might have, say, 3–10 agents each with their task in a pipeline, but not truly all active at once. CrewAI is well-suited for a moderate number of agents in a team — perhaps a “crew” of a half-dozen specialized roles is a reasonable upper bound before the process gets too unwieldy. LangGraph can orchestrate many agents because of its graph structure. If needed, you could design a graph with dozens of nodes (each node could represent an agent or a tool). The practical concurrency would depend on if nodes can run in parallel; LangGraph’s design supports parallel branches, so you could have multiple agents operating simultaneously at different graph positions. This makes LangGraph highly scalable in terms of agent count for complex workflows (e.g., handling a whole network of sub-agents), limited mainly by computational resources and the complexity of managing that many states. OpenAI Swarm typically is used with a handful of agents. Its primary pattern is a triage agent plus a set of specialist agents— perhaps 3 or 4 — which covers many use cases (and aligns with OpenAI’s examples like a support bot handing off to different department agents). There’s no built-in mechanism in Swarm to coordinate large numbers of agents beyond handoffs.\\nIf you tried to involve, say, 20 agents in a single Swarm conversation, it could get chaotic in terms of prompt management. In summary, for small agent groups (<\\\\=5), all frameworks are comfortable; for larger multi-agent swarms (pun intended) with complex coordination, LangGraph or an advanced AutoGen setup would be more appropriate than vanilla Swarm or CrewAI.\\nThroughput and Parallelism\\nWhen it comes to throughput — how many tasks or queries can be handled per second — a lot depends on how well the framework can parallelize or handle asynchronous calls. AutoGen v0.4 introduced full async support, meaning you could spin up multiple conversations or agents in parallel (for example, multiple agent teams each solving a sub-problem, running concurrently). This improves throughput for batch workloads. Its design is robust enough that it could handle multiple simultaneous conversations, limited by the rate of LLM API calls and your hardware. CrewAI, in its default sequential mode, is more serialized: one task after another. To increase throughput, you would likely run multiple Crew instances in parallel (e.g., using threading or asyncio to kick off multiple crew.kickoff() in parallel if they are independent tasks).\\nCrewAI’s core is synchronous for a given crew. Therefore, per single workflow, throughput is one task at a time, but at an application level you can have many crews working concurrently if you manage the concurrency. CrewAI is implemented in Python and doesn’t add heavy overhead per agent action, so it’s feasible to scale out with threads/processes for concurrent crews.\\nLangGraph can achieve high throughput especially for complex pipelines by parallelizing independent branches and leveraging task queues (LangGraph). It was designed with production deployments in mind, including horizontally scaling servers. For instance, if you had a thousand user requests, you could distribute these across a cluster where each runs a LangGraph instance (or even break a single large graph into async tasks). The built-in caching can also boost throughput by skipping steps that have been computed before. Swarm is quite lightweight: each client.run is roughly one chat completion loop. Throughput in Swarm mostly equates to how many run() calls you can execute in parallel (since each is blocking for its sequence of turns). Because it doesn’t manage its own thread pool, achieving high throughput means you have to implement concurrency (for example, use asyncio with run() in an async context or just multi-thread it).\\nIntegration & Deployment\\nExternal API Integration\\nA multi-agent system is useful only if agents can interact with external systems (databases, web services, etc.). All four frameworks allow this, but via different mechanisms. AutoGen provides built-in agent types for tool use — for example, the AssistantAgent can be configured to generate Python code and have it executed via a CodeExecutor (they have a DockerCommandLineCodeExecutor that safely runs code). AutoGen also allows creating custom tools: you can register a function as a tool and let an agent call it (somewhat akin to function calling). There’s also integration with retrieval augmentation (you can have an agent that calls a vector database to fetch info). In short, AutoGen is extensible with tools; you can integrate external APIs either by prompting the agent to use an API (via code) or by implementing an agent that directly calls an API and returns the result as a message. CrewAI leverages LangChain’s tool integration. In fact, you can install crewai[tools] to get a suite of ready-made tools (see CrewAI docs). This means CrewAI agents can use tools like web search, calculators, database queries, etc., similarly to how a LangChain agent would. In a CrewAI workflow, a task could be something like “use the Wikipedia tool to gather info on X”, and the agent behind that task will call the tool and include the results in its output. Because CrewAI emphasizes structured workflows, using an API might be one task and then another agent might process the API result in the next task – this clear separation can be beneficial. You can also integrate any Python API by writing a custom tool function and adding it to CrewAI via the LangChain Tool interface or directly calling it within a task’s logic. LangGraph was built with integration in mind; it can easily integrate with APIs, databases, and external tools. For example, one can include a node in the graph that is a ToolNode (LangChain’s concept of a generic tool executor), or simply write a node function that calls an external API (like an HTTP request) and returns the result. Because LangGraph can maintain state, it’s straightforward to use credentials (like API keys) stored in the state or environment and have multiple agents share them. LangChain’s broad library of integrations (SQL, HTTP, etc.) is at LangGraph’s disposal. Essentially, anything you could do in a LangChain chain, you can do in a LangGraph node – but with the added benefit of coordinating multiple such actions in a directed flow.\\nOpenAI Swarm uses the OpenAI function-calling abilities to integrate tools. Any Python function you attach to an Agent is exposed to the LLM as an available “API” it can call. This is very convenient – to integrate an external API, you can write a Python function that perhaps uses requests or an SDK to call that API, and then list that function in the agent’s functions. The LLM can then choose to call it. For instance, if you want your agent to fetch weather data from an external service, you could implement get_weather() that calls the weather API, and include it in the agent’s tools; the LLM will call get_weather when needed and Swarm will execute the function and provide the JSON result back to the model.\\nSwarm essentially turns your Python functions into OpenAI functions (tools) automatically. There is a limitation: those functions must run quickly and not require user input (since they are called inline during the run() loop). But since you control them, you can handle things like authentication inside those functions (e.g., use stored API tokens) – just ensure not to expose secrets via the model’s output.\\nAuthentication and Security Features\\nWhen deploying in production, security is key — managing API keys, protecting data, etc. AutoGen doesn’t enforce an authentication system of its own (that’s more at the application level), but it supports secure practices. For instance, when using code execution, AutoGen’s default is to run code inside Docker, which sandboxes execution for security. This prevents potentially malicious or accidental harmful code (generated by an agent) from affecting the host environment, a critical security feature. For API keys, you’d typically load them as environment variables and pass them into agent configs (as we saw with os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] in the example)– AutoGen won’t leak those keys in logs unless you explicitly print them. It’s up to the developer to ensure that agents are prompted in a way that they don’t reveal secrets.\\nCrewAI similarly relies on developers to store API keys securely (env vars or a vault). CrewAI itself does not log sensitive info by default (telemetry collects usage metrics but not actual prompts or secrets. For authentication, if you build a multi-agent app (say a web service using CrewAI), you’d implement your own user auth outside of CrewAI and then feed tasks to CrewAI as authorized. One thing to note: because CrewAI is an orchestrator at a higher level, if you incorporate a human-in-the-loop, you should ensure that the human inputs are sanitized to prevent prompt injections that could do something undesirable.\\nLangGraph being targeted at enterprise, provides hooks to integrate with secure data sources and possibly has features for controlling access. Since LangGraph can be deployed within your own VPC or in LangChain’s managed cloud, you have options to keep everything within a private network. Authentication in LangGraph context usually means ensuring the agents (or underlying tools) have proper credentials – e.g., a node that queries a database would use stored credentials that are not exposed to the agent prompts.\\nLangGraph as part of LangChain also means you can use LangChain’s encryption or key management patterns if needed. The framework doesn’t impose additional auth on agent interactions; it assumes you handle that outside (like authenticating the user who triggers the workflow).\\nOpenAI Swarm is minimal from a security perspective: it assumes you have a valid OpenAI API key and doesn’t add layers beyond that. The functions you provide to agents might need to handle authentication (for example, a function to query an internal service should verify the agent is allowed to do so – but in Swarm’s design, if the code is there, the agent can call it, so you might restrict which functions you give to an agent depending on context). One has to be careful with Swarm that the agent instructions don’t inadvertently allow leaking sensitive info: since Swarm doesn’t have an explicit role system beyond the agent prompts, it’s possible an agent could be prompt-injected by a user message to reveal its instructions or other secrets.\\nIt’s on the developer to mitigate that (OpenAI’s function call interface itself is relatively safe, but prompt injection is an ever-present concern). None of these frameworks, out-of-the-box, include user authentication modules (that’s usually application-side).\\nIn terms of secure deployment, frameworks like LangGraph might require locking down certain network routes (if using it to call out to services, ensure those calls are firewalled appropriately). A positive note: CrewAI and AutoGen are open-source, you can inspect them for any telemetry or data handling. CrewAI does telemetry but explicitly states it does NOT collect prompts, responses, or secrets. If desired, you can disable telemetry by not allowing outbound calls or by modifying the code. AutoGen doesn’t do telemetry by default (as far as known). LangGraph (LangChain) by default may log to LangSmith if configured, but you have control over that and can keep data local for compliance.\\nUse Case Implementation\\nIn this section, we provide brief examples for each framework to illustrate a basic multi-agent system, how agents communicate, how you might orchestrate a workflow, persist memory, and handle errors. For brevity, these examples are simplified; real applications might require more setup and robust checks.\\nAutoGen Example (Multi-Agent Conversation)\\nLet’s implement a simple scenario with AutoGen: an assistant agent and a user proxy agent collaborate to answer a question by possibly executing code. We’ll also demonstrate memory persistence through the conversation log and error handling via human-in-loopimport os\\nimport os\\nfrom autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent\\nfrom autogen.coding import DockerCommandLineCodeExecutor  \\n# Configure LLM (using o3-mini via OpenAI API)  \\nopenai_key = os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"]\\nconfig = {\"model\": \"o3-mini\", \"api_key\": openai_key}  \\n# Create agents\\nassistant = AssistantAgent(name=\"assistant\", llm_config={\"config_list\": [config]})  \\n# UserProxyAgent can execute code; attach a Docker-based executor for safety\\ncode_exec = DockerCommandLineCodeExecutor()\\nuser_proxy = UserProxyAgent(name=\"user_proxy\", code_execution_config={\"executor\": code_exec})  \\n# Initiate a multi-agent conversation (UserProxy starts the chat by sending a message to Assistant)\\nuser_proxy.initiate_chat(\\n    assistant,\\n    message=(\"Calculate 2^5 and 3^2, then tell me which is larger and by how much.\")\\n)  \\n# The conversation now proceeds autonomously.  \\n# We can access the conversation logs from either agent if needed:\\nconv_history = assistant.get_chat_history()    \\n# memory of the conversation\\nprint(\"Conversation so far:\\\\n\", conv_history)\\nWe set up an AssistantAgent (which will use GPT-4 to respond) and a UserProxyAgent that represents the user and can execute code in a Docker sandbox. The user’s question asks for a calculation; the assistant might decide to output Python code to do this math. The UserProxyAgent will detect the code block, run it in Docker (ensuring security), and return the result to the assistant. This showcases agent-to-agent communication: the user agent initiates with a question, the assistant agent responds (possibly with a tool invocation), and the user agent executes that tool and replies back with output – all in an automated loop. Memory is persisted in assistant.get_chat_history() as a list of messages, which could be saved to a file or database for long-term storage or debugging. AutoGen maintains this history internally so the assistant can refer back to previous parts of the conversation (short-term memory). If the assistant tried something that failed (e.g., an error in code), the user proxy agent could either ask the assistant to try again or, if configured, involve a human. For example, we could set human_input_mode=\"ALWAYS\" on the user proxy to require human confirmation at each step; that would be a way to handle errors by human intervention (the human could correct the prompt or code). Additionally, AutoGen allows registering a custom error handler; in this scenario, because we used Docker execution, a code error would come back as output to the assistant, which the assistant could parse and perhaps try a different approach (the agents can be prompted to handle error messages robustly).\\n\\nThe above is a simple two-agent loop. For a more complex workflow, say we wanted a third agent (a “ReviewerAgent” that checks the assistant’s answer), we could introduce it by sending the assistant’s final answer to that agent for review before delivering to the user. AutoGen has utilities like GroupChat or you can manually route messages – for brevity, not shown here, but the idea is one agent can call initiate_chat on a third agent, or you manage a turn-taking where after assistant answers, user_proxy forwards it to reviewer agent, then perhaps back to assistant for fixes. This could be done by examining message content and using conditions to route (though AutoGen doesn’t have an explicit graph, you’d implement logic in Python to direct which agent gets the next message).\\nWe demonstrated accessing the chat history. To persist beyond runtime, one could store conv_history externally. AutoGen also supports connecting to external memory stores; for instance, one could integrate with Zep (as this example shows: Agent with memory using Mem0 | AutoGen 0.2) or any vector DB by calling it from an agent. In practice, the simplest persistence is to save important results or decisions to a file/db at each step. AutoGen’s memory is robust enough to maintain coherency in multi-turn chats (the assistant will remember what was previously asked and answered in conv_history).\\nCrewAI Example (Role-Based Team)\\nImagine a scenario with CrewAI: we have two agents, a Researcher and a Writer, working together to produce a report. The Researcher will gather facts (maybe via a tool), and the Writer will compose a summary. We want to show basic orchestration (sequential tasks), and how we might handle memory and errors.\\nfrom crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process\\n# Define agents with roles and goals\\nresearcher = Agent(\\n    role=\"Researcher\",\\n    goal=\"Gather facts about Python\\'s popularity and usage\",\\n    backstory=\"An expert data scientist who provides concise facts.\",\\n    verbose=True  # will log communications for debugging\\n)\\nwriter = Agent(\\n    role=\"Writer\",\\n    goal=\"Draft a brief report based on provided facts\",\\n    backstory=\"A technical writer who explains things clearly.\",\\n    verbose=True\\n)# Create tasks for each agent\\ntask1 = Task(description=\"Find 3 key statistics about Python usage in industry.\", agent=researcher)\\ntask2 = Task(description=\"Summarize these statistics into one paragraph.\", agent=writer)# Assemble the crew with sequential process\\ncrew = Crew(agents=[researcher, writer], tasks=[task1, task2], process=Process.sequential, verbose=True)result = crew.kickoff()  # execute the workflow\\nprint(\"Final result:\\\\n\", result)\\nWe created two Agent instances with specified roles and goals. The researcher’s task is defined to get some stats, and the writer’s task is to summarize. When crew.kickoff() runs, CrewAI will first instruct the Researcher agent to perform Task1. Under the hood, the researcher agent will receive a prompt constructed from its role, goal, and the task description (CrewAI handles prompt assembly).\\n\\nSuppose the Researcher knows to use a tool (if we had integrated a tool, e.g., a web search, we could have added something like tool=\"wiki_browser\" in its configuration, though in this simple snippet we didn’t explicitly integrate an external tool – it will rely on the LLM’s knowledge or we could have given it context).\\nThe output of Task1 – say it comes up with “Python is used by X million developers, is ranked #1 in language popularity on Index Y, and is used by Z% of data scientists.” – is then passed as input to Task2 . CrewAI does this by appending the content from Task1 as additional context (the framework will likely say “Here are the findings: ... Now as a Writer, do Task2”). The Writer agent then produces a paragraph summary. The final result is returned and printed. Throughout, because verbose=True, CrewAI would log each step (e.g., print what the researcher found, then what the writer wrote) which is useful for debugging.\\nIn CrewAI, the agents don’t talk to each other directly. Instead, the Crew orchestrator passes the output of the Researcher as input to the Writer. This is evident in how we structured Task2: it doesn’t explicitly mention the research output, but CrewAI’s sequential process will automatically include Task1’s outcome when prompting the Writer (something like “Based on the facts: [fact1, fact2, fact3], write a paragraph.” gets constructed). This ensures the writer has the necessary context — effectively a form of short-term memory transfer between agents. If we had more tasks, this chain would continue, each receiving the cumulative context of prior tasks.\\n\\nThis example is linear. If we wanted branching (say if the Researcher finds no info, do something else), currently CrewAI would require handling that in code — e.g., you could inspect result = crew.kickoff() and if it indicates failure, run a different Crew or modify tasks. However, CrewAI may introduce parallel or conditional processes in the future. For now, complex orchestration would be achieved by maybe dividing tasks among multiple crews or writing custom Python logic around tasks. The design favors clarity and simplicity – you explicitly set the order. For many real use cases (like a well-defined business process), this is adequate and easier to maintain than an implicit conversation.\\nMemory Persistence\\nCrewAI doesn’t maintain a long conversation buffer like AutoGen; each task is a fresh prompt that includes relevant prior outputs. If you want persistence beyond the single run, you would have to save the results. For example, you might store the research findings in a database and have another crew access them later. The Agent objects do have some memory of their backstory and possibly could retain info across tasks in the same run. CrewAI’s memory system (similar to LangGraph’s, as noted) would allow an agent to remember what it did within that crew.kickoff() invocation. But once the crew execution is done, the agents don’t automatically retain state for the next execution unless you programmatically supply it. In practice, one could serialize important info from result or from each Task if needed for later.\\nHow to handle errors in CrewAI?\\nSuppose the Researcher agent’s output is unsatisfactory (maybe it came back with “I can’t find data”). The Writer might then produce a poor summary or none at all. As a developer, you could check the result content or include criteria in the prompt like “if you found less than 3 stats, say \\'ERROR\\'”. CrewAI itself doesn’t have an internal error propagation, but since you get the outputs as return values, you can implement error handling around it. For instance, after crew.kickoff(), you could do:\\nif \"ERROR\" in result or result is None:\\n    # retry logic: maybe adjust prompt or use a different approach\\n    print(\"Researcher failed to find info. Trying a different approach...\")\\n    # (Here you could create a new Crew or modify tasks and run again)\\nDuring development, you might use the verbose logs to debug why the Researcher failed. If a tool was involved and it threw an exception (say the wiki browser tool failed due to network), that might surface as an exception in Python. Wrapping crew.kickoff() in try/except would allow catching such errors. In a production scenario, one might implement a wrapper that retries the crew execution once or twice before giving up, or falls back to asking a human.\\nCrewAI made it very easy to define a two-step workflow. The roles (“Researcher” and “Writer”) are clearly separated, which can lead to more structured outputs (the Researcher knew to output just facts, the Writer knew to output a narrative). The JSON-like passing of data is handled implicitly, which is convenient. The code is quite readable — someone can glance and understand a “Research then write” pipeline. This is CrewAI’s sweet spot: multi-agent “team” doing well-defined tasks sequentially.\\nLangGraph Example (Graph-Orchestrated Agents)\\nFor LangGraph, let’s consider a slightly more complex orchestration: A supervisor agent decides between two worker agents based on user input. One worker is a QA agent (answer questions) and another is a SQL agent (handle database queries). This demonstrates agent-to-agent routing (communication via state), a complex workflow (branching), memory persistence (shared state), and error handling (we’ll include a finish condition).\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, ToolNode, MessagesState, START, END, Command\\nfrom langgraph.types import BaseMessage\\nfrom typing_extensions import Annotated, TypedDict\\n# Define the structure of the state each agent node will use\\nclass AgentState(TypedDict):\\n    messages: Annotated[list[BaseMessage], ...]  # conversation messages for that agent# Create a LangGraph subgraph for a simple QA agent using an LLM (no external tools here for brevity)\\ndef make_qa_agent(llm):\\n    graph = StateGraph(AgentState)\\n    def qa_node(state: AgentState):\\n        # The QA agent simply returns an answer to the last user question in messages\\n        return {\"messages\": [llm.invoke(state[\"messages\"])]}\\n    graph.add_node(\"qa\", qa_node)\\n    graph.set_entry_point(\"qa\")\\n    return graph.compile()# Similarly, a subgraph for a SQL agent (pretend it executes a query via a tool)\\ndef make_sql_agent(llm, db_tool):\\n    graph = StateGraph(AgentState)\\n    # Node that calls a database query tool, then returns result\\n    tool_node = ToolNode(tools=[db_tool])\\n    graph.add_node(\"query_db\", tool_node)\\n    graph.set_entry_point(\"query_db\")\\n    return graph.compile()# Now, the main graph with a supervisor node to route between QA and SQL agents\\nllm = ...  # assume we have an LLM client (e.g., OpenAI) set up\\ndb_tool = ...  # some LangChain tool for database queries# Compile sub-agents\\nqa_agent = make_qa_agent(llm)\\nsql_agent = make_sql_agent(llm, db_tool)# Main orchestration graph\\nmaster = StateGraph(MessagesState)  # using MessagesState from langgraph\\n# Define supervisor function that routes user input to either QA or SQL\\ndef supervisor(state: MessagesState) -> Command[str]:\\n    # Check user question in state[\"messages\"]\\n    user_msg = next(msg for msg in state[\"messages\"] if msg.role == \"user\").content\\n    if \"database\" in user_msg.lower() or \"query\" in user_msg.lower():\\n        goto = \"sql_node\"\\n    else:\\n        goto = \"qa_node\"\\n    return Command(goto=goto)# Add supervisor node\\nmaster.add_node(\"start\", supervisor)\\n# Add sub-agent nodes and connect\\nmaster.add_subgraph(\"qa_node\", qa_agent)\\nmaster.add_subgraph(\"sql_node\", sql_agent)\\nmaster.add_edge(\"start\", \"qa_node\")  # default edge, will be overridden by Command\\nmaster.add_edge(\"start\", \"sql_node\")\\nmaster.add_edge(\"qa_node\", END)  # after answering, end\\nmaster.add_edge(\"sql_node\", END)  # after query, end\\nmaster.set_entry_point(\"start\")\\napp = master.compile()\\nThis is a bit complex. We defined two subgraphs: one for a QA agent that simply takes a user question and returns an answer (using llm.invoke to call the LLM) (Multi-Agent System Tutorial with LangGraph) (Multi-Agent System Tutorial with LangGraph), and one for a SQL agent that calls a database via a ToolNode (we assume db_tool is defined elsewhere, maybe a LangChain SQLDatabase tool). Then we created a master graph with a supervisor function node. The supervisor looks at the user’s query and decides which agent to route to: if the query mentions “database” or “query”, we assume it’s a database-related request and route to the SQL agent node; otherwise, route to the QA agent node. The supervisor returns a Command(goto=...) with the chosen node. We connect the graph: from the start node (supervisor) to both possible next nodes (qa_node and sql_node), but the Command at runtime will choose one. We also specify that both agent nodes end the conversation by connecting them to END. Finally, we compile the graph into app.\\nThis is a great video that goes over LangGraph’s functional API to build AI workflow agents with minimal code changes:\\nTheir LangGraph playlist is awesome! Check it out:\\nAgent Communication\\nHere, communication is orchestrated: The Supervisor doesn’t send a message to the QA agent in plain language; instead, it uses the Command mechanism to direct the flow. But effectively, the QA node sees the user\\'s message in the state and nothing else (the supervisor doesn’t add content, just routes). If the user’s query was database-related, the SQL node executes and presumably adds an assistant message like “Result of your query: ...” to the state, which then ends. If it was a normal question, the QA node adds an assistant message with the answer. In both cases, the final output is an assistant message answering the user. Agents (QA or SQL) do not directly call each other; the supervisor chooses one, so only one of them runs for a given query. This demonstrates conditional agent invocation, which is a unique strength of LangGraph – you can embed such logic cleanly.\\nComplex Workflow Orchestration\\nLangGraph has branching logic in the supervisor. We could extend this to more branches or even loops (imagine a scenario: the QA agent can’t answer and passes back to supervisor, which then maybe routes to a webSearch agent, etc.). The structure is explicit, which is great for maintaining complex flows. For example, adding a step after SQL query to have the QA agent explain the SQL result in plain English would involve adding an edge from sql_node to qa_node instead of ending immediately, possibly with a flag in state. All of that is possible within the graph design.\\nMemory Persistence\\nThe MessagesState we used is a global state that contains all messages across the flow. So if the user interacts multiple times (assuming we reuse the same compiled app and keep its state), it can remember previous interactions. LangGraph can persist this state (for example, saving to a database after each turn). In our compiled graph, after a run, app.state[\"messages\"] will contain the user’s query and the agent’s answer. If we then call app.run() again with a new user message, by default it might reset or reuse state depending on usage – typically, you’d create a new state for a new conversation, but you can also feed the existing state if continuing a conversation. Because we didn’t explicitly include long-term memory, this example only has the current question/answer in memory. To persist memory, LangGraph could hook into a vector store for long-term knowledge (not shown). But it’s built for that: we could have inserted a memory retrieval node in the graph if needed.\\nReal-World Scenario Highlights\\nEach of the above examples can be extended to real use cases:\\n\\nAutoGen’s two-agent setup is similar to scenarios where an AI assistant uses tools: e.g., an AI math tutor where the assistant agent solves problems step-by-step (maybe with a code tool) while the user agent represents the student. AutoGen’s conversation style fits any scenario with back-and-forth collaboration.\\nCrewAI’s pipeline fits business workflows, like document processing: one agent extracts info, next agent writes a report. It ensures each step is completed before the next begins, making it reliable for things like an AI content generation assembly line.\\nLangGraph’s example is akin to an AI router (triage agent) that delegates to specialized skills. Real-world, this could be a chatbot that either answers from a knowledge base or, if it detects a complex query, runs a SQL query on company data. LangGraph is ideal when you need that deterministic decision-making, such as in customer support automation where certain keywords route the query to different subsystems.\\nSwarm’s handoff example translates to scenarios like a call center bot that seamlessly transfers a user between different skill bots (without needing actual telephony transfer — it’s the same underlying model possibly, but swapping instructions). Or a game where the user can say “let me speak to the wise oracle” and the system switches persona. Swarm’s minimal overhead and stateless design also make it suitable for serverless environments where you handle one request at a time and rely on the client (or session storage) to maintain memory between calls.\\n\\nCybersecurity Considerations\\nMulti-agent frameworks can be leveraged in cybersecurity for tasks like threat intelligence gathering, incident response, log analysis, and automated defense. Let’s assess each framework in that light:\\nAutoGen’s strength in conversation and tool use makes it quite suitable for cybersecurity scenarios requiring collaboration between different “expert” agents. For instance, you could have one agent analyze logs, another agent (maybe a “MalwareExpert”) that examines suspicious files (via a tool or code execution), and a third that composes a report. AutoGen can facilitate such a conversation among agents. Because it supports asynchronous operation, it could handle long-running tasks like scanning large log files without blocking everything. And with human-in-the-loop, an analyst can jump in when needed (cybersecurity often requires human approval before taking certain actions, which AutoGen can allow via the UserProxy agent or configuring human input modes.\\nCrewAI could be used to encode standard operating procedures in incident response. For example, a Crew could have tasks: 1) Triage incident (by an “Analyst” agent), 2) Contain threat (by an “Responder” agent maybe generating firewall rules or isolation steps), 3) Notify team (by a “Reporter” agent writing a summary). Each task can use tools (like querying a threat intel database or generating a report email).\\nLangGraph perhaps is the best suited for complex cybersecurity workflows. Security incident response is often described via flowcharts (if X then Y, else Z), which maps directly to LangGraph’s approach.\\nYou could model an Incident Response playbook as a LangGraph: nodes for detection, classification, containment actions, recovery steps, etc., with conditional edges depending on incident type or success of actions. LangGraph’s integration capabilities mean agents can interface with security tools: one node could pull data from a SIEM, another could run a Splunk query (via a ToolNode), another could create a Jira ticket, etc. The memory and persistence means you can maintain context across an incident’s lifecycle, which might span hours or days.\\nAlso, the auditability is key: you can show a graph of what actions were taken, which is important for compliance in cybersecurity. Security operations often require reliability and minimal false moves — LangGraph’s explicit transitions ensure the AI doesn’t do off-script things easily (compared to a pure LLM approach).\\nAs you can see, each framework has a niche where it’s the optimal choice:\\nAutoGen: Great for scenarios needing dynamic multi-agent conversations, creative problem-solving (e.g., brainstorming among agents), or where asynchronous and long tasks occur.\\nCrewAI: Optimal for structured team workflows — when you have a repeatable process that can be enhanced with AI roles. e.g., content generation pipelines, step-by-step analytical procedures, or any multi-step task that benefits from specialization. Also great when non-technical users need to define workflows since its paradigm is easy to follow (role, task, done).\\nLangGraph: Best for complex decision trees, high reliability, and integration-heavy tasks. If you need to orchestrate many moving parts and ensure the flow is correct (like enterprise workflows, complex data pipelines, or multi-step reasoning that can branch/loop), LangGraph is the choice. It’s also ideal when you need to visualize or audit the agent’s process, which is often a requirement in enterprise settings (think finance, healthcare, and as we discussed, cybersecurity).\\nOpenAI Swarm: Ideal for quick prototyping and lightweight multi-agent experiments, or educational purposes to understand how multi-agent interactions might work. It’s great when you basically want to use the OpenAI API with a bit of structure: e.g., a chatbot with multiple personas, or an agent that can use a handful of tools in a conversation.\\nThank you for being a part of the community\\nBefore you go:\\n\\nBe sure to clap and follow the writer ️👏️️\\nFollow us: X | LinkedIn | YouTube | Newsletter | Podcast | Differ\\nCheck out CoFeed, the smart way to stay up-to-date with the latest in tech 🧪\\nStart your own free AI-powered blog on Differ 🚀\\nJoin our content creators community on Discord 🧑🏻\\u200d💻\\nFor more content, visit plainenglish.io + stackademic.com\\n\\n\\nSign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.\\nFree\\nDistraction-free reading.

      "Relevant content from source: In practice, the framework is Python-based and leverages LangChain under the hood for LLM calls and tools integration (see AI Agents Tools: LangGraph vs Autogen vs Crew AI vs OpenAI Swarm- Key Differences — DEV Community), but it abstracts complexity by offering high-level constructs: each Agent has a role, goal, and optional backstory, and each Task assigns an agent to a specific objective. A mental model difference highlighted by the LangChain team: Autogen frames multi-agent as a free-form conversation, whereas LangGraph frames it as an explicit graph of states/transitions, which can be more intuitive for complex, non-linear workflows. For example, the supervisor looks at the user’s request and decides which agent node (e.g. web_researcher or database_agent) should handle it next, then issues a Command that effectively hands off execution to that agent node (see Multi-Agent System Tutorial with LangGraph).\n",

If you didn\\'t read it, please read my previous content -\\xa0Understanding AI Agents. We have many different frameworks to implement AI Agents. AutoGen from Microsoft is a relatively mature AI Agents framework. Now AutoGen is mainly based on two programming languages .NET and Python. The more mature version is the Python version. The content in this article is mainly based on the Python version\\xa0https://microsoft.github.io/autogen. If you want to learn the .NET version, you can visit here\\xa0https://microsoft.github.io/autogen-for-net\\n\\nAutoGen Features\\n\\nFrom the perspective of AI agents, AutoGen has the ability to be compatible with different LLMs, tool chains for different tasks, and human-computer interaction capabilities. It is an open source framework used to solve the interaction between agents. Its biggest feature is its ability to automate task orchestration, optimize workflow, and have powerful multi-agent conversation capabilities to adjust to workflow or goals. Combined with the different APIs provided in the framework, the cache construction, error handling, different LLMs configurations, context association, dialogue process settings required by the AI agent . Compared with Semantic Kernel and LangChain, the frameworks based on Copilot applications, AutoGen has more advantages in automated task orchestration scenarios and is more front-end-oriented. After receiving the target task, AutoGen can arrange the task, and Semantic Kernel or LangChain are more like providing an ammunition library to solve the task arrangement process, providing various tools and methods that can support the completion of the task.\\nThe construction of AutoGen is very simple. You only need simple code to quickly configure the agent. By building simple anthropomorphic user agents and assistants, you can complete the construction of a simple agent. Here\\'s how to quickly build a single agent\\n1. Configuration file, AutoGen. For configuration files, Azure OpenAI Service is generally placed in the AOAI_CONFIG_LIST in the root directory, such as\\n```json\\n[\\n    {\\n        \"model\": \"Your Azure OpenAI Service Deployment Model Name\",\\n        \"api_key\": \"Your Azure OpenAI Service API Key\",\\n        \"base_url\": \"Your Azure OpenAI Service Endpoin\",\\n        \"api_type\": \"azure\",\\n        \"api_version\": \"Your Azure OpenAI Service version, eg 2023-12-01-preview\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n        \"model\": \"Your Azure OpenAI Service Deployment Model Name\",\\n        \"api_key\": \"Your Azure OpenAI Service API Key\",\\n        \"base_url\": \"Your Azure OpenAI Service Endpoin\",\\n        \"api_type\": \"azure\",\\n        \"api_version\": \"Your Azure OpenAI Service version, eg 2023-12-01-preview\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n        \"model\": \"Your Azure OpenAI Service Deployment Model Name\",\\n        \"api_key\": \"Your Azure OpenAI Service API Key\",\\n        \"base_url\": \"Your Azure OpenAI Service Endpoin\",\\n        \"api_type\": \"azure\",\\n        \"api_version\": \"Your Azure OpenAI Service version, eg 2023-12-01-preview\"\\n    }\\n]\\n```\\nIf it is OpenAI Service, OAI_CONFIG_LIST placed in the root directory, the content includes\\n```json\\n[\\n    {\\n        \"model\": \"Your OpenAI Model Name\",\\n        \"api_key\": \"Your OpenAI API Key\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n        \"model\": \"Your OpenAI Model Name\",\\n        \"api_key\": \"Your OpenAI API Key\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n        \"model\": \"Your OpenAI Model Name\",\\n        \"api_key\": \"Your OpenAI API Key\"\\n    },\\n]\\n```\\nAfter completing the configuration, you can use Python to initial\\n```python\\nconfig_list = autogen.config_list_from_json(\\n    env_or_file=\"AOAI_CONFIG_LIST\",\\n    file_location=\".\",\\n    filter_dict={\\n        \"model\": {\\n            \"Your Model list\"\\n    }\\n},\\n\\n)\\n```\\n2. Create user proxy agent and assistant agent\\n```python\\nCreate an AssistantAgent instance named \"assistant\"\\nassistant = autogen.AssistantAgent(\\n    name=\"assistant\",\\n    llm_config={\\n        \"cache_seed\": 42,\\n        \"config_list\": config_list,\\n    }\\n)\\ncreate a UserProxyAgent instance named \"user_proxy\"\\nuser_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(\\n    name=\"user_proxy\",\\n    human_input_mode=\"ALWAYS\"\\n)\\n```\\nNotice\\nA. The AI agent assistant corresponds to the configuration file and adds a cache. The role of the configuration is to give the agent a powerful \"brain\" and cache memory.\\nB. User proxy agent can simulate human behavior, and you can set whether human intervention occurs. We know that the characteristics of AI agents are not only human thinking, but also human interactive behaviors. When we solve problems through AI agents, we need to consider whether human intervention is needed. You can choose Never. But sometimes you must choose ALWAYS. Because when we need to obtain some APIs, we need some Keys or the cooperation of some network address files. You can set it according to your own scene.\\n3. The last step is to associate the user proxy agent and the assistant agent together and give them a task\\n```python\\nmessages = \"tell me today\\'s top 10 news in the world \"\\nuser_proxy.initiate_chat(assistant, message=messages)\\n```\\nWe can clearly see how the agent completes the complete interaction and generates code to obtain today\\'s latest news. If you want to learn this example, please visit\\nhttps://github.com/kinfey/AutoGenDemo/blob/main/agent_demo_step01.ipynb\\n\\nAutoGen scenarios\\n\\nThere are many implementation scenarios based on AutoGen. You can learn from the cases in\\xa0https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Examples. I would like to tell you how to use AutoGen from two scenarios and how Autogen works through a detailed application scenario.\\nScenarios\\nCase 1: Combining multi-modal capabilities to complete object detection\\nRequirement: During our production process, we need to conduct safety helmet detection. If you find that employees are not wearing safety helmets, please mark it.\\nFrom traditional AI applications, what we need is to collect data of people wearing helmets, label them, complete the model through deep learning training, and then inference and label it. Now that we have multimodal models, we can simplify a lot of our work. In this scenario, we can combine multi-modal agents, code agents, and running-code agents to complete related work.\\n\\nAutoGen supports group chat, and multiple agents can be combined to complete tasks in a session. The code is as follows:\\n```python\\ngroupchat = autogen.GroupChat(agents=[user_proxy, checker,coder, commander], messages=[], max_round=10)\\nmanager = autogen.GroupChatManager(groupchat=groupchat, llm_config=llm_config)\\n```\\nGroup chat can combine different agents to complete tasks, which is very interesting work. If you want to know more, please visit\\nhttps://github.com/kinfey/AutoGenDemo/blob/main/agent_demo_step02.ipynb\\nCase 2: AutoGen powered by Assistant API\\nThe Assistant API is designed for AI agents. You can build AI agent applications with less code through the Assistant API. It integrates capabilities such as state management, context association, chat threads, and code execution, making it easier to access third-party extensions ( Code interpreter, knowledge retrieval and Function Calling, etc.). Although AutoGen already had similar functions before the Assistant API, with the support of the Assistant API, AutoGen can be more flexibly defined in multi-agent scenarios, can set more interactive scenarios, more flexible task execution, and more Good end-to-end process management.\\nNote:\\xa0Before the article was written, AutoGen did not support the Assistant API provided on Azure OpenAI Service, so this article will be completed based on the OpenAI Assistant API.\\nBefore using the Assistant API, the relevant Assistants must be created on the OpenAI or Azure OpenAI Service portal. For details, please refer to\\xa0https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/assistants-quickstart\\nUsing the Assistant API in AutoGen requires adjusting the configuration. The tools type can be set to code_interpreter, retrival, function calling.\\n```python\\nllm_config = {\\n    \"config_list\": config_list,\\n    \"assistant_id\": \"Your OpenAI Assistant ID \", \\n    \"tools\": [{\"type\": \"code_interpreter\"}],\\n    \"file_ids\": [\\n        \"Your OpenAI Assistant File 1\",\\n        \"Your OpenAI Assistant File 2\"\\n    ],\\n}\\n```\\nAI Agent-based settings\\n```python\\ngpt_assistant = GPTAssistantAgent(\\n    name=\"Your Assistant Agent Name\", instructions=\"Your Assistant Agent Instructions \", llm_config=llm_config\\n)\\n```\\nIf you want to try running the contents of this repo, please visit\\nhttps://github.com/kinfey/AutoGenDemo/blob/main/agent_demo_step03.ipynb\\nBuild a visualization solution for AutoGen - AutoGen Studio\\nFor enterprise solutions, more people like to use a combination of visualization and low-code methods to complete relevant workflow settings. Use AutoGen Studio to bring better workflow-based agent-customized visualization solutions to enterprises.\\n\\nInstallation\\nAutoGen Studio is recommended to be started in the Python 3.11 environment. You can use conda to install the Python environment and install the AutoGen Studio package.\\n```bash\\nconda create -n agstudioenv python=3.11.7\\nconda activate agstudioenv\\npip install autogenstudio \\n```\\nRemember to configure OPENAI_API_KEY or your AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY before starting\\n```bash\\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=\\'Your OpenAI Key\\'\\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=\\'Your Azure OpenAI Service Key\\'\\n```\\nStart your AutoGen Studio, where port is the network port and can be set as needed\\n```bash\\nautogenstudio ui --port 8088\\n```\\nUse Case/Scenario\\nEveryone knows that I am a Premier League fan. I hope to build an AI agent to help me analyze the situation of each Premier League team in the new season based on the standings.\\n\\nAssemble ammunition for your AI agent\\nAutoGen Studio now supports configuring skills, models, agents, and workflows. These four functions can be seen by selecting the Build menu.\\n1. Skills\\xa0Different functions can be added to the agent through Python. Here I add a get_league_standing Skills.\\nNote:\\xa0You need to register\\xa0https://www.football-data.org/\\xa0to get API Key\\n```python\\nimport requests\\nimport json\\ndef get_league_standings(api_key=\\'Your football-data API Key\\'):\\n    url = \"http://api.football-data.org/v4/competitions/PL/standings\"\\n    headers = {\"X-Auth-Token\": api_key}\\n    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\\n    data = response.json()\\nstandings = []\\n\\nif \\'standings\\' in data:\\n    for standing in data[\\'standings\\']:\\n        if standing[\\'type\\'] == \\'TOTAL\\':  \\n            for team in standing[\\'table\\']:\\n                team_data = {\\n                    \"position\": team[\\'position\\'],\\n                    \"teamName\": team[\\'team\\'][\\'name\\'],\\n                    \"playedGames\": team[\\'playedGames\\'],\\n                    \"won\": team[\\'won\\'],\\n                    \"draw\": team[\\'draw\\'],\\n                    \"lost\": team[\\'lost\\'],\\n                    \"points\": team[\\'points\\'],\\n                    \"goalsFor\": team[\\'goalsFor\\'],\\n                    \"goalsAgainst\": team[\\'goalsAgainst\\'],\\n                    \"goalDifference\": team[\\'goalDifference\\']\\n                }\\n                standings.append(team_data)\\n            break\\n\\n    standings_json = json.dumps(standings, ensure_ascii=False, indent=4)\\n    return standings_json\\nelse:\\n    return \"Error\"\\n\\n```\\nAfter saving, as shown in the figure\\n\\n2. Models\\xa0corresponds to the binding of the LLMs. The design needs to set the Key of OpenAI or Azure OpenAI Service before starting. We add a binding of the gpt-4-turbo model. Here we use Azure OpenAI Services service, so the name and EndPoint of the deployment need to correspond one-to-one with your Azure OpenAI Service\\n\\n3. Agents\\xa0Add your AI agent. You can set different agents here. In our case, we only need to set up a single agent. Add a football_expert_assistant agent here and set a role for the system and bind the Skill - get_league_standing and Models just added, as shown in the figure.\\n\\n4. Workflows\\xa0We can set the workflow of the agent and the interactive dialogue workflow of the agent. We set the simplest two agent interaction mode - \"Two Agents.\"\\n\\nWe need to set up the receiver - Receiver and bind the set football_expert_assistant\\'s agent and LLMs.\\n\\nRunning Your Agents\\nYou can run your application through the Playground in the AutoGen Studio UI. You only need to create a Session to correspond to the set Workflows.\\n\\nThe result:  \\n\\nOf course, you can also publish the agent by selecting Session, which can be viewed through the Gallery menu.\\nSummary\\nAutoGen is a relatively comprehensive AI agent framework. For enterprises that want to build AI agents, it not only provides an application framework, but also provides a visual and interactive visual UI of AutoGen, which lowers the entry barrier for intelligent agents and allows more people to take advantage of intelligent agents. We have taken the first step to build an AI agent using AutoGen, and will incorporate more advanced content in the following series.\\nResources\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft

If you want to learn the .NET version, you can visit here\\xa0https://microsoft.github.io/autogen-for-net\\n\\\\n\\n\\nAutoGen Features\\n\\n\\\\nFrom the perspective of AI agents, AutoGen has the ability to be compatible with different LLMs, tool chains for different tasks, and human-computer interaction capabilities. It is an open source framework used to solve the interaction between agents. Its biggest feature is its ability to automate task orchestration, optimize workflow, and have powerful multi-agent conversation capabilities to adjust to workflow or goals. Combined with the different APIs provided in the framework, the cache construction, error handling, different LLMs configurations, context association, dialogue process settings required by the AI agent . Compared with Semantic Kernel and LangChain, the frameworks based on Copilot applications, AutoGen has more advantages in automated task orchestration scenarios and is more front-end-oriented. After receiving the target task, AutoGen can arrange the task, and Semantic Kernel or LangChain are more like providing an ammunition library to solve the task arrangement process, providing various tools and methods that can support the completion of the task.\\n\\\\nThe construction of AutoGen is very simple. You only need simple code to quickly configure the agent. By building simple anthropomorphic user agents and assistants, you can complete the construction of a simple agent. Here\\'s how to quickly build a single agent\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n1. Configuration file, AutoGen. For configuration files, Azure OpenAI Service is generally placed in the AOAI_CONFIG_LIST in the root directory, such as\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n[\\\\n    {\\\\n        \\\\\"model\\\\\": \\\\\"Your Azure OpenAI Service Deployment Model Name\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\"api_key\\\\\": \\\\\"Your Azure OpenAI Service API Key\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\"base_url\\\\\": \\\\\"Your Azure OpenAI Service Endpoin\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\"api_type\\\\\": \\\\\"azure\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\"api_version\\\\\": \\\\\"Your Azure OpenAI Service version, eg 2023-12-01-preview\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n        \\\\\"model\\\\\": \\\\\"Your Azure OpenAI Service Deployment Model Name\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\"api_key\\\\\": \\\\\"Your Azure OpenAI Service API Key\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\"base_url\\\\\": \\\\\"Your Azure OpenAI Service Endpoin\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\"api_type\\\\\": \\\\\"azure\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\"api_version\\\\\": \\\\\"Your Azure OpenAI Service version, eg 2023-12-01-preview\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n        \\\\\"model\\\\\": \\\\\"Your Azure OpenAI Service Deployment Model Name\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\"api_key\\\\\": \\\\\"Your Azure OpenAI Service API Key\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\"base_url\\\\\": \\\\\"Your Azure OpenAI Service Endpoin\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\"api_type\\\\\": \\\\\"azure\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\"api_version\\\\\": \\\\\"Your Azure OpenAI Service version, eg 2023-12-01-preview\\\\\"\\\\n    }\\\\n]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nIf it is OpenAI Service, OAI_CONFIG_LIST placed in the root directory, the content includes\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n[\\\\n    {\\\\n        \\\\\"model\\\\\": \\\\\"Your OpenAI Model Name\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\"api_key\\\\\": \\\\\"Your OpenAI API Key\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n        \\\\\"model\\\\\": \\\\\"Your OpenAI Model Name\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\"api_key\\\\\": \\\\\"Your OpenAI API Key\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n        \\\\\"model\\\\\": \\\\\"Your OpenAI Model Name\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\"api_key\\\\\": \\\\\"Your OpenAI API Key\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nAfter completing the configuration, you can use Python to initial\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nconfig_list = autogen.config_list_from_json(\\\\n    env_or_file=\\\\\"AOAI_CONFIG_LIST\\\\\",\\\\n    file_location=\\\\\".\\\\\",\\\\n    filter_dict={\\\\n        \\\\\"model\\\\\": {\\\\n            \\\\\"Your Model list\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n        }\\\\n    },\\\\n)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n2. Create user proxy agent and assistant agent\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n# Create an AssistantAgent instance named \\\\\"assistant\\\\\"\\\\nassistant = autogen.AssistantAgent(\\\\n    name=\\\\\"assistant\\\\\",\\\\n    llm_config={\\\\n        \\\\\"cache_seed\\\\\": 42,\\\\n        \\\\\"config_list\\\\\": config_list,\\\\n    }\\\\n)\\\\n# create a UserProxyAgent instance named \\\\\"user_proxy\\\\\"\\\\nuser_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(\\\\n    name=\\\\\"user_proxy\\\\\",\\\\n    human_input_mode=\\\\\"ALWAYS\\\\\"\\\\n)\\\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nNotice\\n\\\\nA. The AI agent assistant corresponds to the configuration file and adds a cache. The role of the configuration is to give the agent a powerful \\\\\"brain\\\\\" and cache memory.\\n\\\\nB. User proxy agent can simulate human behavior, and you can set whether human intervention occurs. We know that the characteristics of AI agents are not only human thinking, but also human interactive behaviors. When we solve problems through AI agents, we need to consider whether human intervention is needed. You can choose Never. But sometimes you must choose ALWAYS. Because when we need to obtain some APIs, we need some Keys or the cooperation of some network address files. You can set it according to your own scene.\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n3. The last step is to associate the user proxy agent and the assistant agent together and give them a task\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nmessages = \\\\\"tell me today\\'s top 10 news in the world \\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nuser_proxy.initiate_chat(assistant, message=messages)\\\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nWe can clearly see how the agent completes the complete interaction and generates code to obtain today\\'s latest news. If you want to learn this example, please visit\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\nhttps://github.com/kinfey/AutoGenDemo/blob/main/agent_demo_step01.ipynb\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\nAutoGen scenarios\\n\\n\\\\nThere are many implementation scenarios based on AutoGen. You can learn from the cases in\\xa0https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Examples. I would like to tell you how to use AutoGen from two scenarios and how Autogen works through a detailed application scenario.\\n\\\\n\\nScenarios\\n\\\\n_Case 1: Combining multi-modal capabilities to complete object detection_\\n\\\\nRequirement: During our production process, we need to conduct safety helmet detection. If you find that employees are not wearing safety helmets, please mark it.\\n\\\\nFrom traditional AI applications, what we need is to collect data of people wearing helmets, label them, complete the model through deep learning training, and then inference and label it. Now that we have multimodal models, we can simplify a lot of our work. In this scenario, we can combine multi-modal agents, code agents, and running-code agents to complete related work.\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nAutoGen supports group chat, and multiple agents can be combined to complete tasks in a session. The code is as follows:\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\ngroupchat = autogen.GroupChat(agents=[user_proxy, checker,coder, commander], messages=[], max_round=10)\\\\n\\\\nmanager = autogen.GroupChatManager(groupchat=groupchat, llm_config=llm_config)\\\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nGroup chat can combine different agents to complete tasks, which is very interesting work. If you want to know more, please visit\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\nhttps://github.com/kinfey/AutoGenDemo/blob/main/agent_demo_step02.ipynb\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n_Case 2: AutoGen powered by Assistant API_\\n\\\\nThe Assistant API is designed for AI agents. You can build AI agent applications with less code through the Assistant API. It integrates capabilities such as state management, context association, chat threads, and code execution, making it easier to access third-party extensions ( Code interpreter, knowledge retrieval and Function Calling, etc.). Although AutoGen already had similar functions before the Assistant API, with the support of the Assistant API, AutoGen can be more flexibly defined in multi-agent scenarios, can set more interactive scenarios, more flexible task execution, and more Good end-to-end process management.\\n\\\\n_Note:_\\xa0Before the article was written, AutoGen did not support the Assistant API provided on Azure OpenAI Service, so this article will be completed based on the OpenAI Assistant API.\\n\\\\nBefore using the Assistant API, the relevant Assistants must be created on the OpenAI or Azure OpenAI Service portal. For details, please refer to\\xa0https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/assistants-quickstart\\n\\\\nUsing the Assistant API in AutoGen requires adjusting the configuration. The tools type can be set to code_interpreter, retrival, function calling.\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nllm_config = {\\\\n    \\\\\"config_list\\\\\": config_list,\\\\n    \\\\\"assistant_id\\\\\": \\\\\"Your OpenAI Assistant ID \\\\\", \\\\n    \\\\\"tools\\\\\": [{\\\\\"type\\\\\": \\\\\"code_interpreter\\\\\"}],\\\\n    \\\\\"file_ids\\\\\": [\\\\n        \\\\\"Your OpenAI Assistant File 1\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\"Your OpenAI Assistant File 2\\\\\"\\\\n    ],\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nAI Agent-based settings\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\ngpt_assistant = GPTAssistantAgent(\\\\n    name=\\\\\"Your Assistant Agent Name\\\\\", instructions=\\\\\"Your Assistant Agent Instructions \\\\\", llm_config=llm_config\\\\n)\\\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nIf you want to try running the contents of this repo, please visit\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\nhttps://github.com/kinfey/AutoGenDemo/blob/main/agent_demo_step03.ipynb\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\nBuild a visualization solution for AutoGen - AutoGen Studio\\n\\\\nFor enterprise solutions, more people like to use a combination of visualization and low-code methods to complete relevant workflow settings. Use AutoGen Studio to bring better workflow-based agent-customized visualization solutions to enterprises.\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\nInstallation\\n\\\\nAutoGen Studio is recommended to be started in the Python 3.11 environment. You can use conda to install the Python environment and install the AutoGen Studio package.\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nconda create -n agstudioenv python=3.11.7\\\\n\\\\nconda activate agstudioenv\\\\n\\\\npip install autogenstudio \\\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nRemember to configure OPENAI_API_KEY or your AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY before starting\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=\\'Your OpenAI Key\\'\\\\n\\\\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=\\'Your Azure OpenAI Service Key\\'\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nStart your AutoGen Studio, where port is the network port and can be set as needed\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nautogenstudio ui --port 8088\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\nUse Case/Scenario\\n\\\\nEveryone knows that I am a Premier League fan. I hope to build an AI agent to help me analyze the situation of each Premier League team in the new season based on the standings.\\n\\\\n\\nAssemble ammunition for your AI agent\\n\\\\nAutoGen Studio now supports configuring skills, models, agents, and workflows. These four functions can be seen by selecting the Build menu.\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n_1. Skills_\\xa0Different functions can be added to the agent through Python. Here I add a get_league_standing Skills.\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nNote:\\xa0You need to register\\xa0https://www.football-data.org/\\xa0to get API Key\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nimport requests\\\\nimport json\\\\n\\\\ndef get_league_standings(api_key=\\'Your football-data API Key\\'):\\\\n    url = \\\\\"http://api.football-data.org/v4/competitions/PL/standings\\\\\"\\\\n    headers = {\\\\\"X-Auth-Token\\\\\": api_key}\\\\n    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\\\\n    data = response.json()\\\\n\\\\n    standings = []  \\\\n\\\\n    if \\'standings\\' in data:\\\\n        for standing in data[\\'standings\\']:\\\\n            if standing[\\'type\\'] == \\'TOTAL\\':  \\\\n                for team in standing[\\'table\\']:\\\\n                    team_data = {\\\\n                        \\\\\"position\\\\\": team[\\'position\\'],\\\\n                        \\\\\"teamName\\\\\": team[\\'team\\'][\\'name\\'],\\\\n                        \\\\\"playedGames\\\\\": team[\\'playedGames\\'],\\\\n                        \\\\\"won\\\\\": team[\\'won\\'],\\\\n                        \\\\\"draw\\\\\": team[\\'draw\\'],\\\\n                        \\\\\"lost\\\\\": team[\\'lost\\'],\\\\n                        \\\\\"points\\\\\": team[\\'points\\'],\\\\n                        \\\\\"goalsFor\\\\\": team[\\'goalsFor\\'],\\\\n                        \\\\\"goalsAgainst\\\\\": team[\\'goalsAgainst\\'],\\\\n                        \\\\\"goalDifference\\\\\": team[\\'goalDifference\\']\\\\n                    }\\\\n                    standings.append(team_data)\\\\n                break  \\\\n\\\\n        standings_json = json.dumps(standings, ensure_ascii=False, indent=4)\\\\n        return standings_json\\\\n    else:\\\\n        return \\\\\"Error\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nAfter saving, as shown in the figure\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n_2. Models_\\xa0corresponds to the binding of the LLMs. The design needs to set the Key of OpenAI or Azure OpenAI Service before starting. We add a binding of the gpt-4-turbo model. Here we use Azure OpenAI Services service, so the name and EndPoint of the deployment need to correspond one-to-one with your Azure OpenAI Service\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n_3. Agents_\\xa0Add your AI agent. You can set different agents here. In our case, we only need to set up a single agent. Add a football_expert_assistant agent here and set a role for the system and bind the Skill - get_league_standing and Models just added, as shown in the figure.\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n_4. Workflows_\\xa0We can set the workflow of the agent and the interactive dialogue workflow of the agent. We set the simplest two agent interaction mode - \\\\\"Two Agents.\\\\\"\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nWe need to set up the receiver - Receiver and bind the set football_expert_assistant\\'s agent and LLMs.\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nRunning Your Agents\\n\\\\nYou can run your application through the Playground in the AutoGen Studio UI. You only need to create a Session to correspond to the set Workflows.\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nThe result:  \\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nOf course, you can also publish the agent by selecting Session, which can be viewed through the Gallery menu.\\n\\\\n\\nSummary\\n\\\\nAutoGen is a relatively comprehensive AI agent framework. For enterprises that want to build AI agents, it not only provides an application framework, but also provides a visual and interactive visual UI of AutoGen, which lowers the entry barrier for intelligent agents and allows more people to take advantage of intelligent agents.

If you want to learn this example, please visit\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\nhttps://github.com/kinfey/AutoGenDemo/blob/main/agent_demo_step01.ipynb\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\nAutoGen scenarios\\n\\n\\\\nThere are many implementation scenarios based on AutoGen. You can learn from the cases in\\xa0https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Examples. I would like to tell you how to use AutoGen from two scenarios and how Autogen works through a detailed application scenario.\\n\\\\n\\nScenarios\\n\\\\n_Case 1: Combining multi-modal capabilities to complete object detection_\\n\\\\nRequirement: During our production process, we need to conduct safety helmet detection. If you find that employees are not wearing safety helmets, please mark it.\\n\\\\nFrom traditional AI applications, what we need is to collect data of people wearing helmets, label them, complete the model through deep learning training, and then inference and label it. Now that we have multimodal models, we can simplify a lot of our work. In this scenario, we can combine multi-modal agents, code agents, and running-code agents to complete related work.\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nAutoGen supports group chat, and multiple agents can be combined to complete tasks in a session. The code is as follows:\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\ngroupchat = autogen.GroupChat(agents=[user_proxy, checker,coder, commander], messages=[], max_round=10)\\\\n\\\\nmanager = autogen.GroupChatManager(groupchat=groupchat, llm_config=llm_config)\\\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nGroup chat can combine different agents to complete tasks, which is very interesting work. If you want to know more, please visit\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\nhttps://github.com/kinfey/AutoGenDemo/blob/main/agent_demo_step02.ipynb\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n_Case 2: AutoGen powered by Assistant API_\\n\\\\nThe Assistant API is designed for AI agents. You can build AI agent applications with less code through the Assistant API. It integrates capabilities such as state management, context association, chat threads, and code execution, making it easier to access third-party extensions ( Code interpreter, knowledge retrieval and Function Calling, etc.). Although AutoGen already had similar functions before the Assistant API, with the support of the Assistant API, AutoGen can be more flexibly defined in multi-agent scenarios, can set more interactive scenarios, more flexible task execution, and more Good end-to-end process management.\\n\\\\n_Note:_\\xa0Before the article was written, AutoGen did not support the Assistant API provided on Azure OpenAI Service, so this article will be completed based on the OpenAI Assistant API.\\n\\\\nBefore using the Assistant API, the relevant Assistants must be created on the OpenAI or Azure OpenAI Service portal. For details, please refer to\\xa0https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/assistants-quickstart\\n\\\\nUsing the Assistant API in AutoGen requires adjusting the configuration. The tools type can be set to code_interpreter, retrival, function calling.\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nllm_config = {\\\\n    \\\\\"config_list\\\\\": config_list,\\\\n    \\\\\"assistant_id\\\\\": \\\\\"Your OpenAI Assistant ID \\\\\", \\\\n    \\\\\"tools\\\\\": [{\\\\\"type\\\\\": \\\\\"code_interpreter\\\\\"}],\\\\n    \\\\\"file_ids\\\\\": [\\\\n        \\\\\"Your OpenAI Assistant File 1\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\"Your OpenAI Assistant File 2\\\\\"\\\\n    ],\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nAI Agent-based settings\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\ngpt_assistant = GPTAssistantAgent(\\\\n    name=\\\\\"Your Assistant Agent Name\\\\\", instructions=\\\\\"Your Assistant Agent Instructions \\\\\", llm_config=llm_config\\\\n)\\\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nIf you want to try running the contents of this repo, please visit\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\nhttps://github.com/kinfey/AutoGenDemo/blob/main/agent_demo_step03.ipynb\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\nBuild a visualization solution for AutoGen - AutoGen Studio\\n\\\\nFor enterprise solutions, more people like to use a combination of visualization and low-code methods to complete relevant workflow settings. Use AutoGen Studio to bring better workflow-based agent-customized visualization solutions to enterprises.\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\nInstallation\\n\\\\nAutoGen Studio is recommended to be started in the Python 3.11 environment.

I hope to build an AI agent to help me analyze the situation of each Premier League team in the new season based on the standings.\\n\\\\n\\nAssemble ammunition for your AI agent\\n\\\\nAutoGen Studio now supports configuring skills, models, agents, and workflows. These four functions can be seen by selecting the Build menu.\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n_1. Skills_\\xa0Different functions can be added to the agent through Python. Here I add a get_league_standing Skills.\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nNote:\\xa0You need to register\\xa0https://www.football-data.org/\\xa0to get API Key\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nimport requests\\\\nimport json\\\\n\\\\ndef get_league_standings(api_key=\\'Your football-data API Key\\'):\\\\n    url = \\\\\"http://api.football-data.org/v4/competitions/PL/standings\\\\\"\\\\n    headers = {\\\\\"X-Auth-Token\\\\\": api_key}\\\\n    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\\\\n    data = response.json()\\\\n\\\\n    standings = []  \\\\n\\\\n    if \\'standings\\' in data:\\\\n        for standing in data[\\'standings\\']:\\\\n            if standing[\\'type\\'] == \\'TOTAL\\':  \\\\n                for team in standing[\\'table\\']:\\\\n                    team_data = {\\\\n                        \\\\\"position\\\\\": team[\\'position\\'],\\\\n                        \\\\\"teamName\\\\\": team[\\'team\\'][\\'name\\'],\\\\n                        \\\\\"playedGames\\\\\": team[\\'playedGames\\'],\\\\n                        \\\\\"won\\\\\": team[\\'won\\'],\\\\n                        \\\\\"draw\\\\\": team[\\'draw\\'],\\\\n                        \\\\\"lost\\\\\": team[\\'lost\\'],\\\\n                        \\\\\"points\\\\\": team[\\'points\\'],\\\\n                        \\\\\"goalsFor\\\\\": team[\\'goalsFor\\'],\\\\n                        \\\\\"goalsAgainst\\\\\": team[\\'goalsAgainst\\'],\\\\n                        \\\\\"goalDifference\\\\\": team[\\'goalDifference\\']\\\\n                    }\\\\n                    standings.append(team_data)\\\\n                break  \\\\n\\\\n        standings_json = json.dumps(standings, ensure_ascii=False, indent=4)\\\\n        return standings_json\\\\n    else:\\\\n        return \\\\\"Error\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nAfter saving, as shown in the figure\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n_2. Models_\\xa0corresponds to the binding of the LLMs. The design needs to set the Key of OpenAI or Azure OpenAI Service before starting. We add a binding of the gpt-4-turbo model. Here we use Azure OpenAI Services service, so the name and EndPoint of the deployment need to correspond one-to-one with your Azure OpenAI Service\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n_3. Agents_\\xa0Add your AI agent. You can set different agents here. In our case, we only need to set up a single agent. Add a football_expert_assistant agent here and set a role for the system and bind the Skill - get_league_standing and Models just added, as shown in the figure.\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n_4. Workflows_\\xa0We can set the workflow of the agent and the interactive dialogue workflow of the agent. We set the simplest two agent interaction mode - \\\\\"Two Agents.\\\\\"\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nWe need to set up the receiver - Receiver and bind the set football_expert_assistant\\'s agent and LLMs.\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nRunning Your Agents\\n\\\\nYou can run your application through the Playground in the AutoGen Studio UI. You only need to create a Session to correspond to the set Workflows.\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe result:\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\nOf course, you can also publish the agent by selecting Session, which can be viewed through the Gallery menu.\\n\\\\n\\nSummary\\n\\\\nAutoGen is a relatively comprehensive AI agent framework. For enterprises that want to build AI agents, it not only provides an application framework, but also provides a visual and interactive visual UI of AutoGen, which lowers the entry barrier for intelligent agents and allows more people to take advantage of intelligent agents. We have taken the first step to build an AI agent using AutoGen, and will incorporate more advanced content in the following series.\\n\\\\n\\nResources\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n1.  \\\\nMicrosoft AutoGen\\xa0https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/\\n\\\\\\\\n\\n\\n\\\\n2.  \\\\nMicrosoft AutoGen Studio UI 2.0\\xa0https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/12/01/AutoGenStudio/\\n\\\\\\\\n\\n\\n\\\\n3.  \\\\nAutoGen Studio: Interactively Explore Multi-Agent Workflows\\xa0https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/12/01/AutoGenStudio/\\n\\\\\\\\n\\n\\n\\\\n4.  \\\\nAzure OpenAI Service Assistant API Docs\\xa0https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/assistants-quickstart\\n\\\\\\\\n\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\",\"kudosSumWeight\":1,\"postTime\":\"2024-02-09T00:00:00.033-08:00\",\"images\":{\"__typename\":\"AssociatedImageConnection\",\"edges\":[{\"__typename\":\"AssociatedImageEdge\",\"cursor\":\"MjQuMTF8Mi4xfG98MjV8X05WX3wx\",\"node\":{\"__ref\":\"AssociatedImage:{\\\\\"url\\\\\":\\\\\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00MDUyMjgwLTU1MDA2OWk3QjQ5N0VFRkJENUYwQ0RG?revision=6\\\\\"}\"}},{\"__typename\":\"AssociatedImageEdge\",\"cursor\":\"MjQuMTF8Mi4xfG98MjV8X05WX3wy\",\"node\":{\"__ref\":\"AssociatedImage:{\\\\\"url\\\\\":\\\\\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00MDUyMjgwLTU1MDA3MGlGQjlDNjcwNjEzRDhBOUYz?revision=6\\\\\"}\"}},{\"__typename\":\"AssociatedImageEdge\",\"cursor\":\"MjQuMTF8Mi4xfG98MjV8X05WX3wz\",\"node\":{\"__ref\":\"AssociatedImage:{\\\\\"url\\\\\":\\\\\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00MDUyMjgwLTU1MDA3MmlDNzFDNkJCMDQyOTBCNEJC?revision=6\\\\\"}\"}},{\"__typename\":\"AssociatedImageEdge\",\"cursor\":\"MjQuMTF8Mi4xfG98MjV8X05WX3w0\",\"node\":{\"__ref\":\"AssociatedImage:{\\\\\"url\\\\\":\\\\\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00MDUyMjgwLTU1MDA3M2k4OTUxMzE1NzgwODNBMUYz?revision=6\\\\\"}\"}},{\"__typename\":\"AssociatedImageEdge\",\"cursor\":\"MjQuMTF8Mi4xfG98MjV8X05WX3w1\",\"node\":{\"__ref\":\"AssociatedImage:{\\\\\"url\\\\\":\\\\\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00MDUyMjgwLTU1MDA3NGk2QjJEREM4MzhBNTlGOUUx?revision=6\\\\\"}\"}},{\"__typename\":\"AssociatedImageEdge\",\"cursor\":\"MjQuMTF8Mi4xfG98MjV8X05WX3w2\",\"node\":{\"__ref\":\"AssociatedImage:{\\\\\"url\\\\\":\\\\\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00MDUyMjgwLTU1MDA3OGlDQjZFMTk3MDg5MjcxMTk1?revision=6\\\\\"}\"}},{\"__typename\":\"AssociatedImageEdge\",\"cursor\":\"MjQuMTF8Mi4xfG98MjV8X05WX3w3\",\"node\":{\"__ref\":\"AssociatedImage:{\\\\\"url\\\\\":\\\\\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00MDUyMjgwLTU1MDA3OWkzNTZBQTkzRjE1QTFFQTc1?revision=6\\\\\"}\"}},{\"__typename\":\"AssociatedImageEdge\",\"cursor\":\"MjQuMTF8Mi4xfG98MjV8X05WX3w4\",\"node\":{\"__ref\":\"AssociatedImage:{\\\\\"url\\\\\":\\\\\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00MDUyMjgwLTU1MDA4MGlEMzRBQTNEMzY4MzIyQzdG?revision=6\\\\\"}\"}},{\"__typename\":\"AssociatedImageEdge\",\"cursor\":\"MjQuMTF8Mi4xfG98MjV8X05WX3w5\",\"node\":{\"__ref\":\"AssociatedImage:{\\\\\"url\\\\\":\\\\\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00MDUyMjgwLTU1MDA4MWlENDIwMzU2NDVFQUIzMTNF?revision=6\\\\\"}\"}}],\"totalCount\":9,\"pageInfo\":{\"__typename\":\"PageInfo\",\"hasNextPage\":false,\"endCursor\":null,\"hasPreviousPage\":false,\"startCursor\":null}},\"attachments\":{\"__typename\":\"AttachmentConnection\",\"pageInfo\":{\"__typename\":\"PageInfo\",\"hasNextPage\":false,\"endCursor\":null,\"hasPreviousPage\":false,\"startCursor\":null},\"edges\":[]},\"tags\":{\"__typename\":\"TagConnection\",\"pageInfo\":{\"__typename\":\"PageInfo\",\"hasNextPage\":false,\"endCursor\":null,\"hasPreviousPage\":false,\"startCursor\":null},\"edges\":[{\"__typename\":\"TagEdge\",\"cursor\":\"MjQuMTF8Mi4xfG98MTB8X05WX3wx\",\"node\":{\"__typename\":\"Tag\",\"id\":\"tag:ai\",\"text\":\"ai\",\"time\":\"2018-01-27T01:25:04.985-08:00\",\"lastActivityTime\":null,\"messagesCount\":null,\"followersCount\":null}},{\"__typename\":\"TagEdge\",\"cursor\":\"MjQuMTF8Mi4xfG98MTB8X05WX3wy\",\"node\":{\"__typename\":\"Tag\",\"id\":\"tag:AutoGen\",\"text\":\"AutoGen\",\"time\":\"2024-01-26T01:09:24.627-08:00\",\"lastActivityTime\":null,\"messagesCount\":null,\"followersCount\":null}},{\"__typename\":\"TagEdge\",\"cursor\":\"MjQuMTF8Mi4xfG98MTB8X05WX3wz\",\"node\":{\"__typename\":\"Tag\",\"id\":\"tag:Azure Open AI Services\",\"text\":\"Azure Open AI Services\",\"time\":\"2023-03-15T00:00:00.039-07:00\",\"lastActivityTime\":null,\"messagesCount\":null,\"followersCount\":null}}]},\"timeToRead\":8,\"rawTeaser\":\"In the previous content, we learned about AI Agent.

It allows developers to model AI applications as directed graphs, where each node represents a processing step and edges define data flow.  This visual and modular approach simplifies the development of complex AI pipelines, such as chatbots, data retrieval systems, or decision-making systems.\\n\\nLangGraph distinguishes itself by enabling cycles in its graphs, allowing for more complex, agent-like behaviors. This means LLMs can be called in loops, enabling them to dynamically adapt and make decisions based on ongoing interactions. The LangGraph Platform offers a service for deploying and scaling these applications, including APIs for building user experiences and an integrated developer studio.\\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] https://blog.devgenius.io/the-ultimate-guide-to-langgraph-all-aspects-explained-9d4891df9c99\\n[2] https://www.langchain.com/langgraph \\n[3] https://medium.com/@cplog/introduction-to-langgraph-a-beginners-guide-14f9be027141\\n\\n\\n\\n')]}}\n",

LangGraph excels in multi-agent pattern support due to its graph-based approach, simplifying complex interactions. CrewAI shines with its structured role-based design, facilitating efficient management of multiple agents. Autogen, on the other hand, boasts strong code execution capabilities. \\n\\nAll three frameworks prioritize ease of use, memory support, structured output, comprehensive documentation, and caching mechanisms.

These agents leverage LLMs to perform a wide range of tasks, from generating sales leads to making investment decisions. However, the choice of framework for building these agents can significantly affect their efficiency and effectiveness. In this blog, we will evaluate three prominent frameworks for building AI agents — LangGraph, Autogen, and Crew AI — to help you make an informed choice.\\nBy the way, we are constantly sharing our insights on agents. Don\\'t miss out on other pieces in the Mastering Agents series.\\n\\nTypes of agents\\nLangGraph Vs Autogen Vs Crew AI\\nHow to evaluate agents\\nLearn to fix agents\\nTop agent benchmarks\\nMetrics for chatbot agents\\n\\nWhat is an Agent?\\nAn agent in AI is a software application that uses LLMs to perform specific tasks autonomously. These tasks can range from answering research questions to invoking backend services. Agents can be particularly useful in scenarios requiring open-ended answers, where they can provide surprisingly effective solutions.\\nCustomer support agents are capable of addressing customer inquiries, supplying information, and autonomously resolving issues. While code generation agents can generate, debug, and run code snippets, assisting developers in automating repetitive tasks.\\n\\n\\nAutoDev: Automated AI-Driven Development\\nWhen to Use Agents\\nAgents are highly beneficial when tasks require complex decision-making, autonomy, and adaptability. They excel in environments where the workflow is dynamic and involves multiple steps or interactions that can benefit from automation. For instance, in customer support, agents can handle a wide range of queries, provide real-time assistance, and escalate issues to human operators when necessary. This not only improves efficiency but also enhances the customer experience by providing timely and accurate responses.\\nIn research and data analysis, agents can autonomously gather, process, and analyze large volumes of data, providing valuable insights without human intervention. They are also useful in scenarios requiring real-time data processing, such as financial trading, where agents can make split-second decisions based on market conditions.\\nMoreover, agents are beneficial in educational applications, where they can provide personalized learning experiences, adapt to the student\\'s pace, and offer instant feedback. In software development, agents can assist in code generation, debugging, and testing, significantly reducing development time and improving code quality. The ability of agents to learn from interactions and improve over time makes them invaluable in environments where continuous improvement and adaptation are crucial.\\nWhen Not to Use Agents\\nAgents offer numerous advantages but there are scenarios where their use may not be the right choice.\\nTo be clear, in scenarios where tasks are straightforward, infrequent, or require minimal automation, the complexity of implementing agents may not be justified. Simple tasks that existing software solutions can easily manage do not necessarily benefit from the added complexity of agent-based systems. In such cases, traditional methods are more efficient and cost-effective.\\nAdditionally, tasks that require deep domain-specific knowledge and expertise, which cannot be easily encoded into an agent, may not benefit from automation. For instance, complex legal analysis, intricate medical diagnoses, or high-stakes decision-making in uncertain environments often require the expertise and intuition of seasoned professionals. In such cases, relying solely on agents can lead to suboptimal or even harmful outcomes.\\nAgents are also not well-suited for tasks that require a high level of human empathy, creativity, or subjective judgment. For example, in fields such as psychotherapy, counseling, or creative writing, the nuances of human emotions and creativity are difficult for agents to replicate. In these cases, human interaction is irreplaceable and essential for achieving the desired outcomes.\\nImplementing agents requires a significant investment in terms of time, resources, and expertise. For small businesses or projects with limited budgets, the cost of developing and maintaining agents may outweigh the benefits. Furthermore, in highly regulated industries, the use of agents may be restricted due to compliance and security concerns. Ensuring that agents adhere to stringent regulatory requirements can be challenging and resource-intensive.\\nLangGraph vs Autogen vs Crew AI\\nHaving clarified when to utilize an agent, let’s shift our focus to the primary topic: the most widely adopted frameworks in the industry. We conducted a poll and identified three frameworks that are most commonly used. Let’s begin with a high-level overview of these frameworks.\\n\\n\\nLangGraph\\nLangGraph is an open-source framework designed by Langchain to build stateful, multi-actor applications using LLMs. Inspired by the long history of representing data processing pipelines as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), LangGraph treats workflows as graphs where each node represents a specific task or function.

This includes hierarchical, sequential, and dynamic interaction patterns.\\nGrouping tools and responsibilities can yield better results, as an agent is more likely to succeed on a focused task than if it has to select from dozens of tools. Separate prompts can also enhance performance, allowing each prompt to have its own instructions and few-shot examples. Each agent can even be powered by a separate fine-tuned LLM, providing a helpful conceptual model for development. This approach allows for evaluating and improving each agent individually without disrupting the larger application.\\nLangGraph: LangGraph supports various multi-agent patterns, including hierarchical and dynamic group chats. It allows users to define complex interaction patterns between agents. The framework\\'s graph-based approach makes it easy to visualize and manage these interactions. LangGraph prefers an approach where you explicitly define different agents and transition probabilities, representing them as nodes in a graph. This graphical approach provides the highest flexibility for constructing complex and opinionated workflows, where controlling the transition probabilities between nodes is crucial.\\nAutogen: Autogen emerged as one of the first multi-agent frameworks, framing workflows more as \"conversations\" between agents. This conversational approach provides flexibility in defining how agents interact with each other, supporting multiple conversation patterns, including sequential and nested chats. Autogen\\'s design makes it easy to manage complex multi-agent interactions, allowing agents to collaborate effectively..\\nCrew AI: Crew AI supports role-based interactions and autonomous delegation between agents. It provides processes like sequential and hierarchical task execution to manage multi-agent interactions effectively. This ensures that agents can work together efficiently to achieve common goals. Crew AI is a higher-level framework compared to LangGraph, focusing on creating multi-agent \"teams\" that operate cohesively.\\n\\nWinner: LangGraph has an edge due to its graph-based approach, which makes it easier to visualize and manage complex interactions.\\n\\nCaching\\nCaching is useful in reducing latency and resource consumption of agents by storing and reusing previously computed results.\\nLangGraph: LangGraph supports caching through its built-in persistence layer. This allows users to save and resume graph execution at any point. The caching mechanism ensures that previously computed results can be reused, improving performance.\\nAutogen: AutoGen supports caching API requests so that they can be reused when the same request is issued.\\nCrew AI: All tools in Crew AI support caching, enabling agents to efficiently reuse previously obtained results, reducing the load on external resources and speeding up the execution time. You can also define finer control over the caching mechanism using the cache_function attribute of the tool.\\n\\nWinner: All of the frameworks support caching but LangGraph and CrewAI might have an edge.\\n\\nReplay\\nReplay functionality allows users to revisit and analyze previous interactions, which is useful for debugging and improving agent performance. It enables users to understand the decision-making process and identify areas for improvement.\\nLangGraph: LangGraph supports replay through its time travel feature. Users can rewind and explore alternative paths, making it easier to debug and experiment with different scenarios. This feature provides a detailed history of interactions, allowing for thorough analysis.\\nAutogen: Autogen does not have an explicit replay feature, but users can manually update the state to control the agent\\'s trajectory. This allows for some level of replay functionality, although it may require more manual intervention.\\nCrew AI: CrewAI provides the ability to replay from a task specified from the latest crew kickoff. Currently, only the latest kickoff is supported and it will only allow you to replay from the most recent crew run.\\n\\nWinner: LangGraph and Crew AI both make it easy to replay with inbuilt capabilities.\\n\\nCode Execution\\nCode execution capabilities enable agents to perform complex tasks by writing and executing code.
